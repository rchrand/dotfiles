2013-12-18 15:34:09	alexisisis	someone suggested powertop to me last night for fixing Cinnamon (battery lasting 20 seconds) but what am I supposed to do with that? It just seems to be an extended task manager
2013-12-18 15:35:11	HardyH	A battery that lasts 20 seconds only needs to be replaced
2013-12-18 15:36:08	alexisisis	but it last 10mins with xfce. I know it needs to be replaced but I only need it to move from one room to another. With Cinnamon I can't even do that.

2013-12-18 15:40:12	alexisisis	HardyH, but it's not dead. It last 10mins in xfce. 10mins is fine for me, that's all I need. The issue is that something is wrong in Cinnamon that doesn't even allow me that
2013-12-18 15:40:20	+AHD42	hmm..
2013-12-18 15:40:31	alexisisis	AHD42, thanks for that link, I'll read. Yeah 20 seconds, timed it last night
2013-12-18 15:40:33	+AHD42	you like dead horses then?
2013-12-18 15:40:37	HardyH	Cinnamon required 3d acceleration and puts much more load on your gpu

2013-12-18 15:42:29	alexisisis	even so, 10mins>20secs seems a bit extreme. I don't think it is that the battery is actually completely empty, I think it's shutting off because it is critical, possibly the percentage too high.
2013-12-18 15:42:33	HardyH	What kind of cpu/gpu are we talking about, alexisisis?

2013-12-18 15:43:29	HardyH	So, tell us your problem
2013-12-18 15:43:46	Disobedience	The problem is. my HDMI audio does not show up as an option to use.
2013-12-18 15:44:12	HardyH	Well, not sure, but I think powertop is obsolete for intel cpus, there's pstate now included in the kernel
2013-12-18 15:45:54	+AHD42	what does "aplay -l" say? drop it into a pastebin pls
2013-12-18 15:46:52	alexisisis	HardyH, I'm not sure what is dictating the power config in it, it is shutting down rather than hibernating and also closing the lid when plugged in is locking the screen rather than doing nothing like I have set in the power options
