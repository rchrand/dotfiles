2013-11-12 13:43:00	universa1	Corey: sorry wrong highlight :(
2013-11-12 13:43:34	corp_	universa1, like Account.join(...)... or something?
2013-11-12 13:43:43	MonkeyTrousers	I've got a rails 2 project that uses the 'contacts' gem, I'm getting a n error because its using gdata 1.1.1 which tries to require 'jcode'

2013-11-12 15:41:23	bassclef	is this how I would submit a checkbox on a form, ONLY if it is checked?  I'm just making the switch to rails, want to make sure I understand form helpers properly.

2013-11-12 15:41:33	greengriminal	universa1: I know what it was. When I was trying to do a rollback that removes the previous migration right. So whats happening is thats its trying to drop the migration. So what I did was create a new migration and did remove_column. Accidendtly did `    remove_column :alerts, :lock_version, :integer` then found out that when removing columns you don't specifiy the datatype.

2013-11-12 19:27:51	tubbo	arkie: if you're scraping data in the background, like in a job or something (asynchronously), how will you persist that data in one process and recall it in another without storing the data somehere, like in a data model?

2013-11-12 19:29:08	tubbo	arkie: seems like you'd be better off doing that periodically, saving that to the database somehow, and then using a model in your controller to recall that information when it's requested. the model can be the liason between the raw data you scraped into the DB and the user interface (be it an API or a GUI)

2013-11-12 19:30:25	arkie	the other thing i was thinking of was a .rake
2013-11-12 19:30:33	arkie	but im probably way off the mark there tubbo
2013-11-12 19:30:33	arkie	:P
2013-11-12 19:31:35	tubbo	arkie: the one caveat you have to be aware of is this scraping process will not be efficient if you do it in the middle of a request-response cycle.
2013-11-12 19:32:16	csaunders	lethjakman: Maybe just monkey patch the things that are missing? Or submit a PR? If the missing features line up with the project of course!
2013-11-12 19:32:37	EminenceHC	How would I make this statement case insensitive: .where(:users => {:first_name => params[:first_name]})
2013-11-12 19:32:38	arkie	so basically i have train time for a particular station in both directions, i want people to be able to select a train time and say if it was late or cancelled and report it
2013-11-12 19:32:46	arkie	thats pretty much what im aiming for tubbo

2013-11-12 19:34:12	tubbo	arkie: a rake that runs periodically in cron might do the trick for now. but i think it would be better to use resque and resque-scheduler to periodically scrape and persist train times to your own local database. resque is just a one off "enqueue this right now" thing, but resque-scheduler will allow you to say, enqueue a job in 2 hours and then at the end of another job, re-enqueue the job to run.
2013-11-12 19:34:15	tubbo	which sort-of emulates a daemon
2013-11-12 19:34:30	tubbo	or you could just run a daemon process that sleeps for like 60 seconds per request
2013-11-12 19:34:58	-->	aspires has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-11-12 19:35:03	tubbo	arkie: it seems like you may want these to be "up to date" at all times, but you don't necessarily believe these times are going to be changing rapidly. so it's probably good to keep data that's maybe a few hours old around for speed purposes.
2013-11-12 19:35:25	arkie	the train times only change probably 2 times a year
2013-11-12 19:35:47	tubbo	arkie: oh, well maybe you can just get away with scraping *all* the data at once?
2013-11-12 19:36:02	arkie	thats what i was thinking
2013-11-12 19:36:04	tubbo	one rake task, one database population, and when you need to change you just truncate the table and re-scrape all the times
2013-11-12 19:36:07	arkie	and is that easiest in a rake?
2013-11-12 19:36:08	tubbo	boom.
2013-11-12 19:36:21	tubbo	arkie: yeah. i'd build a little class that does all the work, that way you can test the object rather than the Rake task.
2013-11-12 19:36:56	tubbo	so your task would pretty much be defined as `task('db:populate' => :environment) { DbPopulator.execute }`

If you think that ideally you're just gonna have one dashboard in your app, and a homepage or whatever, could someone tell me if the following logic is correct? Create all the models necessary for the "objects" in your app, create a static pages controller for your pages, create a view for each separate page?

2013-11-12 20:10:16	arkie	just reading and getting more confused haha
2013-11-12 20:10:20	smathy	lxsameer, so how do you think this will deploy to more than one server?  There's no code hinting that you're trying to do more than one server here.
2013-11-12 20:10:38	bricker	digital-ghost: whoever told you 'i18n.t(...)' wasn't dry was trying to look smart.
2013-11-12 20:10:53	smathy	Anyway, lxsameer, this is the code in my own deploy.rb that we use to deploy to two environments: https://gist.github.com/smathy/7436725
2013-11-12 20:10:59	digital-ghost	Is this the correct way of handling it?
2013-11-12 20:11:04	tubbo	arkie: it's fine that you're new to RoR, but you're not helping yourself if you just read tutorials and guides on how to do everything (because if you rely on guides and they are wrong/outdated, you just screwed yourself...bad habits are hard to break)

2013-11-12 20:11:47	tubbo	arkie: i think it's best to pick a gem which you use a lot and find reliable, then inspect its source code when you need "inspiration". i pretty much learned how to build rails generators solely from the plataformatec/devise repo
2013-11-12 20:11:48	smathy	lxsameer, ...and then you deploy to stage with `cap deploy` and to live with `cap live deploy`

2013-11-12 20:14:11	tubbo	you can use libs and gems with little or shitty documentation
2013-11-12 20:14:22	Kamuela	tubbo: would i create an entire view for someone's username, email, and collection of stored widgets? that'd represent user object and widget object, but why specific views for one dashboard? not challenging, trying to understand

2013-11-12 20:15:47	tubbo	Kamuela: i would say you would create a view for *someone*, and in that view would include a way of rendering their username, email, widgets, etc.
2013-11-12 20:15:56	tubbo	Kamuela: and why can't that view live at /users/1?
2013-11-12 20:16:45	arkie	isnt this what my rake should look like?

2013-11-12 20:17:08	tubbo	Kamuela: fwiw, it's probably best to create a DashboardController (and app/views/dashboard) to house all your dashboard views and possibly special queries. that is, unless you wish to make the page static and just make ajax calls (with no layout in the response), which would save you some code.
2013-11-12 20:17:10	arkie	can i have multiple URLs in the 1 rake file?
2013-11-12 20:17:50	tubbo	arkie: yeah, there's no constraint around how many URLs you can have in a Rakefile
2013-11-12 20:18:07	tubbo	arkie: though i wonder why you're making the same req twice, and why it's so horribly indented :D
2013-11-12 20:18:15	Kamuela	tubbo, in this example, it is not social. so there should be no public view of said information

2013-11-12 20:23:45	tubbo	Kamuela: Ruby is a language of choices, and it puts the dev at the drivers seat to make those choices. the choices you make can make your life a lot easier, but they can also make it harder.

2013-11-12 20:24:59	Kamuela	tubbo, I think the most difficult thing I have understanding conceptually is controllers. I get databasing/business logic, and the delivering it to a view. But what is a controller DOING
2013-11-12 20:25:03	-->	cschep has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-11-12 20:25:56	s2013	bricker, so basically everytime an unit "checksin" we get data from that unit, parse it and create a new record, once a new record is created we update another table with some of that data
2013-11-12 20:26:09	s2013	this checkin happens few times a day for few hundred units
2013-11-12 20:27:10	tubbo	Kamuela: it's the glue between your data models and your view layer. the main job of the controller is really to parse out params and feed them to your model so your model can generate SQL queries and persist the data or fetch data from a persisted source.
2013-11-12 20:27:52	tubbo	s2013: be careful with data-dependent jobs like that. we have race conditions *all* the time and basically had to resort to after_commit since we would get into instances where Resque read from an old version of the data
2013-11-12 20:28:27	s2013	yeah i figured after_commit should sort of deal with that cause we only want to fire off the stuff after the data is saved/commited

2013-11-12 20:30:01	tubbo	and make your jobs small enough where they don't need all that data.

2013-11-12 20:59:44	tubbo	gita: it uses inflectors to change the way a word looks, so 'expectations' becomes 'Expectation', etc.
2013-11-12 21:00:19	tubbo	and then Ruby has ways of turning that into an actual constant, so you can do class_name = 'Expectation'; class_name.constantize.new
2013-11-12 21:00:23	tubbo	in ruby i believe that'd be const_get(name).new

2013-11-12 21:44:01	helpa	Pastebin is not good because it loads slowly for most, has ads which are distracting and has terrible formatting. Please use Gist (http://gist.github.com) or Pastie (http://pastie.org) instead. Thanks!

2013-11-14 22:12:43	rhizome	yes, rename the column, but you already said you can't do that.
2013-11-14 22:12:48	AntelopeSalad	when i call the source method, i'm using the return value to reach in and grab its name and type
2013-11-14 22:12:51	rhizome	so i'm out of ideas
2013-11-14 22:12:55	s2013	shit
2013-11-14 22:13:03	s2013	cause the column is used everywhere in the company

2013-11-14 22:13:44	rhizome	that sounds like a problem. maybe there's a way to hide it under a different name
2013-11-14 22:14:02	bricker	What's that called in programming when your method doesn't return the same type of object? There's a term for it.
2013-11-14 22:14:06	bricker	Rule or something
2013-11-14 22:14:06	bricker	or something like that
2013-11-14 22:14:11	AntelopeSalad	both event and comment have a name method exposed and the type is just the class name
2013-11-14 22:14:12	AntelopeSalad	so basically the only time i'm using the source method is when i want some bits of info that is common to both

2013-11-14 22:56:04	Radar	louism2wash: and that the DBMS channel would probably be more help determining what tat SQL statement is.

2013-11-14 22:56:15	edektor	I'm tracking some data in my app (leaderboards, activity, etc) with Redis. The keys in Redis need to be updated whenever some change on a model happens. Would Observers or Callbacks be the route to go?
2013-11-14 22:56:21	Radar	perfectritone_: and application.css is just application.css and not application.css.scss or something else?

2013-11-15 21:35:42	tubbo	billy_ran_away: if you POST to your controller, you just need to do 'POST /controller_name'. you don't need the "/create" on the end. especially if this is a Backbone app
2013-11-15 21:35:45	billy_ran_away	toretore: okay well I appreciate your time but I can't post my company's entire backbone app...
2013-11-15 21:35:56	tubbo	billy_ran_away: you should just be able to POST /controller => {params in json}
2013-11-15 21:36:09	toretore	tubbo: that's lethjakman ;)
2013-11-15 21:36:16	tubbo	oh
2013-11-15 21:36:31	billy_ran_away	tubbo: Yea, that's what I'm doing in my spec, I'm posting a string with an invalid UTF-8 character, /xae, it's failing, trying to make it green.
2013-11-15 21:36:44	toretore	tubbo: and it's exactly why i told him to paste his code, because there's most likely no url like that in his app
2013-11-15 21:36:49	tubbo	billy_ran_away: one thing that jumps out at me about the error line...you're using `and` as a boolean operand and that's not the right way to use that.
2013-11-15 21:37:01	tubbo	billy_ran_away: `and` is for boolean control flow, you should be using `&&` if you're in a boolean expression.
2013-11-15 21:37:22	tubbo	not sure if that's causing your problem right now but it will in the future believe me :)

2013-11-15 21:37:51	billy_ran_away	toretore: it's not a URL problem, it's a utf-8 encoding problem from the data the user is submitting in the form
2013-11-15 21:37:58	tubbo	s2013: what is a "rails variable" and how is it different from any other variable. also it makes no sense.

2013-11-15 21:38:36	s2013	my hash is lets say just h
2013-11-15 21:38:40	toretore	you have given us exactly 0 lines of code to work with
2013-11-15 21:38:57	tubbo	s2013: hash keys can only be strings or symbols, iirc.

2013-11-15 21:39:05	s2013	so it cant be an integer?
2013-11-15 21:39:11	tubbo	nope, has to be a symbol or a string.

2013-11-15 21:39:51	tubbo	ok

2013-11-15 22:06:41	PPH	hey guy, if I want to create a website. I use rails to deal with the "app" part of my website but I also need sone static html. Should I still use views and controller to manage the static part so the routes will not conflict?

2013-11-15 23:05:06	cmiller	tubbo: the best apps are rails 2 apps that used to be access databases that used to be excel spreadsheets. oh, and the original coder on the rails 2 app was "kinda new to programming." (read: no indentation)

2013-11-15 23:10:57	PPH	When I fetch an account or anything else from cpanel api i get a json string with ugly/unconventionnal variable names. From now on, I used those names to names on my own variables so i can simply do account.new(json_from_cpanel). Is there a way I can map their ugly variables it my fancy variables without having to define 20+ accessors?
2013-11-15 23:11:38	cmiller	AntelopeSalad: CarrierWave seems more fine-tuned for handling image uploads, whereas Paperclip seems to handle non-image data more gracefully. I'd suggest using Git branches to try both out and stick with whichever one you like better.

2013-11-20 21:58:48	pothibo	skyjumper I'd need to confirm (And maybe tubbo can pitch in as he seems to know a lot) but I believe it's an anonymous class that wraps information about Quiz & AR::Relation so it can dispatch the method to the proper object through something like method_missing(). This is why you can call scopes and class method ont the same object

2013-11-20 22:04:38	pothibo	skyjumper self in Quiz is Quiz. Your issue is that you misundersand how scopes are handled within rails. When you called your class method, you broke off the actual query building you were doing. By doing scope() at the beginning, you create  a new query. So. If you have a where() clause then scope() everything before scope() will be ignore

I was going to just use hstore for this...but I would like to have a bit more control for proper type casting of values...should I just serialize with the Hash coder? Or use the JSON coder?

2013-11-24 14:35:50	robinboening	I want to share methods between capistrano receipts and rake tasks in a gem. I created a module and required it in both files. I also need to include it, so the methods are available to use. If I would NOT wrap the methods into a module I would not need to include it, just requiring the file would do it. But what way is better? module or not?

2013-11-24 20:06:27	universa1	axl_: define some middleware
2013-11-24 20:06:31	axl_	or for me to look into the value of a  segment

2013-11-24 20:19:04	Radar	BrazenBraden: so what is the problem?
2013-11-24 20:19:18	BrazenBraden	the app runs but when i navigate to the engine, my routes with devise break
2013-11-24 20:19:30	BrazenBraden	i get NameError - undefined local variable or method `destroy_user_session_path'
2013-11-24 20:19:38	Radar	BrazenBraden: use main_app.destroy_user_session_path for those routes.

2013-11-24 20:21:16	Radar	BrazenBraden: If you're pointing to routes that exist within the application from the engine, you will need to use main_app.

2013-11-24 20:21:23	BrazenBraden	i am not doubting you.. i am just saying that i have a previous project working without defining it
2013-11-24 20:21:33	Radar	If you're pointing to routes that exist within an engine from the application, you'll need to use the engine_name.
2013-11-24 20:21:34	BrazenBraden	oh a misunderstandinmg

2013-11-24 21:08:59	JRizzle	any reason why ?
2013-11-24 21:09:05	JRizzle	using devise/cancan/rolify
2013-11-24 21:09:28	bricker`LA	JRizzle: probably because redirect_to expects a hash or a string, not a symbol
2013-11-24 21:09:30	bricker`LA	just a guess
2013-11-24 21:09:51	bricker`LA	or an ActiveRecord object, I guess
2013-11-24 21:10:17	bricker`LA	either that or there's no `admin?` method on current_user
2013-11-24 21:10:20	DanBoy	new_session_path without the symbol
2013-11-24 21:11:01	DanBoy	ya does devise by default add that admin column
2013-11-24 21:11:06	DanBoy	i don't think so
2013-11-24 21:11:13	JRizzle	yes! just got it haha , then looked back and saw you said that
2013-11-24 21:12:00	JRizzle	the composer did not add the admin column by default, had to use a migration to addadmintouser
2013-11-24 21:12:03	JRizzle	and set the boolean to true
2013-11-24 21:12:17	DanBoy	gist your schema.rb zcreative
2013-11-24 21:12:36	JRizzle	then used before_filter :authorize_user! and the before filter i pasted earlier

I am building a forum, and I have four controllers (for this section). A forum has many threads, which has many posts and many users. In the forum view show, i need to display the last person who posted in each
2013-11-24 21:31:12	Lindsiria	thread. At the moment it shows the user_id of the last poster, but i can't get it to display the name (which would be in the user table). Here is the section of code: http://pastie.org/8505793

2013-11-24 21:35:50	Lindsiria	last_poster_id is the foreign key to the table user and its ID

2013-11-25 10:17:40	tobago	elaptics, we have to preset a lot of data for the application, but most of the data should be editable depending on the client, who is using the application.
2013-11-25 10:17:49	bricker`LA	seeds.rb is used to setup a database, i.e. to be run once. That's why it's part of the db:setup rake task.

2013-11-25 11:08:35	rvanlieshout	maybe you should just look a bit more before just grabbing an other solution
2013-11-25 11:09:27	rvanlieshout	and why the need for compass?
2013-11-25 11:09:27	rvanlieshout	for bootstrap
2013-11-25 11:09:27	jarr0dsz	it is not an asset inclusion issue its problem with haml not working so thought looking for alternative
2013-11-25 11:09:27	rvanlieshout	huh
2013-11-25 11:09:27	rvanlieshout	then why include bootstrap in your problem?
2013-11-25 11:09:27	jarr0dsz	i use compass for css rendering beside bootstrap
2013-11-25 11:09:27	DaniG2k	does anyone here know how to use geocoder decently?
2013-11-25 11:09:56	rvanlieshout	jarr0dsz: and be more specific about 'haml not working'... it's just better to think about the actual problem before just using something else

2013-11-25 11:12:54	rvanlieshout	aah.. i've seen this problem weeks ago

2013-11-25 11:13:13	rvanlieshout	the []?
2013-11-25 11:13:20	DaniG2k	for instance, if I type in 'London, United Kingdom'
2013-11-25 11:13:24	DaniG2k	it should be geocoding that
2013-11-25 11:14:10	DaniG2k	if I do Geocoder.search 'London' in the console it's fine, it returns multiple results (london uk, london ontario...etc)
2013-11-25 11:14:10	DaniG2k	but when I pass this through the website form, it gets nil results

2013-11-25 11:16:36	DaniG2k	thats the thing
2013-11-25 11:16:36	rvanlieshout	what else could it use?
2013-11-25 11:16:36	DaniG2k	this geocoded_by seems to be doing something else
2013-11-25 11:16:36	workmad3	DaniG2k: so check the code for it
2013-11-25 11:16:36	rvanlieshout	DaniG2k: then remove the 'seems to be' part and view the source
2013-11-25 11:16:36	DaniG2k	i dont know but it shoudl return *something* for London

2013-11-25 11:24:47	elaptics	that's what you've told it to use to geocode

2013-11-25 11:26:16	workmad3	DaniG2k: ok... from what?
2013-11-25 11:26:22	DaniG2k	it returns a results packet
2013-11-25 11:26:27	DaniG2k	with a bunch of info
2013-11-25 11:26:30	DaniG2k	i thought address was in there
2013-11-25 11:26:39	workmad3	DaniG2k: ok... and what did you think it would use to get those results?
2013-11-25 11:26:42	DaniG2k	and that doing obj.address = geo.address was filling that i
2013-11-25 11:26:53	elaptics	DaniG2k: but how do you think geocoder is getting information to search for results?
2013-11-25 11:26:54	DaniG2k	well now I will try with address
2013-11-25 11:29:03	DaniG2k	oooh i see what i was doing
2013-11-25 11:29:28	DaniG2k	in my tutors controller i have a method called parse_geolocation that does this:

2013-11-25 11:37:12	rvanlieshout	but it should not reside in the controller
2013-11-25 11:37:13	rvanlieshout	this type of logic
2013-11-25 11:37:41	elaptics	DaniG2k: what actual fields do you have in your model that relate to address data in some way?
2013-11-25 11:38:06	DaniG2k	elaptics: the form contains [p[:country], p[:postalcode], p[:city], p[:street]
2013-11-25 11:38:06	GeorgesLeYeti	I'm using gem bootsrap-sass (version 2.3.2.2) and i have some problem with bootstrap popover. I had the //= require bootstrap under application.js.erb file and for other bootstrap js module like modal it works fine but neither tooltip nor popover works.
2013-11-25 11:38:27	DaniG2k	elaptics: and the address field gets created when the form is submitted with the following params[:tutor][:address] = [p[:country], p[:postalcode], p[:city], p[:street]].delete_if(&:empty?).join ', '
2013-11-25 11:38:37	DaniG2k	and then thats the address that gets geocoded
2013-11-25 11:38:40	GeorgesLeYeti	When i look into my application.js (on nav) i see them
2013-11-25 11:38:56	rvanlieshout	GeorgesLeYeti: and found javascript errors on your javascript console?
2013-11-25 11:39:12	elaptics	DaniG2k: so "address" is also a field in your database?
2013-11-25 11:39:14	GeorgesLeYeti	rvanlieshout: no i didn't get any errors
2013-11-25 11:39:29	rvanlieshout	GeorgesLeYeti: and what did you do to make them work? changed html.. added listeners?
2013-11-25 11:39:32	GeorgesLeYeti	The strange thing is when i add <script src="/assets/bootstrap-tooltip.js" type="text/javascript"></script> then it works
2013-11-25 11:39:38	DaniG2k	elaptics: yes
2013-11-25 11:39:58	DaniG2k	t.string   "address"
2013-11-25 11:40:19	rvanlieshout	GeorgesLeYeti: and the javascript in that file is in your application.js?
2013-11-25 11:40:27	rvanlieshout	in the browser
2013-11-25 11:40:34	rvanlieshout	because then you must have a js error

2013-11-25 11:41:06	GeorgesLeYeti	rvanlieshout: i swear i didn't get any error.
2013-11-25 11:41:09	elaptics	DaniG2k: well if you really want the structured data then I'd store each component in the database, otherwise just have a single text field address and let the user fill that in. If you want the structured data, then make address a virtual attribute by creating it from the components in the model
2013-11-25 11:41:30	DaniG2k	elaptics: I have the others stored in the model as well
2013-11-25 11:41:33	DaniG2k	i store all of them
2013-11-25 11:41:55	GeorgesLeYeti	I even add every js with (//= require bootstrap-modal //=require bootstrap-tooltip ....)
2013-11-25 11:41:59	GeorgesLeYeti	Same issue
2013-11-25 11:42:04	elaptics	DaniG2k: so dump the address field from the db itself - you're just duplicating information
2013-11-25 11:42:09	DaniG2k	country, city, postcode, street and address, wich gets populated by the latter.
2013-11-25 11:42:16	rvanlieshout	greenrose: add a break point in your js console for the line that enables it
2013-11-25 11:42:33	DaniG2k	elaptics: no, becase then Geocoder kicks in and overwrites the city, street, postcode in a proper format
2013-11-25 11:42:34	-->	brookr has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-11-25 11:42:41	DaniG2k	so the address is kept as a safe alternative
2013-11-25 11:42:59	DaniG2k	but what gets populated by geocoder is the important stuff

2013-11-25 11:43:09	elaptics	DaniG2k: what do you want geocoder to actually do, presumeably just get the latitude and longitude?
2013-11-25 11:43:35	DaniG2k	elaptics: it populates the fields properly for one
2013-11-25 11:43:40	DaniG2k	elaptics: it also gets latitude and longitude
2013-11-25 11:43:49	DaniG2k	elaptics: which I'll use for google maps later on

2013-11-25 11:46:16	elaptics	DaniG2k: I'm lost. I don't understand what you're trying to achieve. Either the user has entered an address which doesn't get touched and you attempt to get a lat/long using it, or you're also additionally going to replace what the user typed in to "correct" them or help them enter a full address from asking for less information

2013-11-25 11:49:55	DaniG2k	elaptics: so what happesn is I pass it into the address field and let geocoder serach for it

2013-11-25 11:50:36	DaniG2k	elaptics: this isn't duplication of effort because, what if the user doesnt input the info in the right fields?
2013-11-25 11:50:52	DaniG2k	or if it's typed incorrectly
2013-11-25 11:50:52	DaniG2k	geocoder takes care of that
2013-11-25 11:50:54	DaniG2k	see what I mean?
2013-11-25 11:50:57	elaptics	so you are replacing what the user enters then
2013-11-25 11:51:04	DaniG2k	basically, yes
2013-11-25 11:51:05	DaniG2k	as a security measure
2013-11-25 11:51:42	workmad3	DaniG2k: how is that a 'security measure'?
2013-11-25 11:51:48	DaniG2k	well not a security measure in the CS sense, but a safety net for incorrect inputs
2013-11-25 11:52:53	workmad3	DaniG2k: ok... so why bother letting the user enter anything there at all?
2013-11-25 11:53:00	elaptics	DaniG2k: I still think you need to sort out your field named "address", not least because you're overwriting rails methods with that address_changed? method you've created

2013-11-25 13:44:02	andrewvos	drop/8
2013-11-25 13:44:06	jarr0dsz	yes indeed :) its a production "test" db i need to wipeout

2013-11-25 13:46:05	jarr0dsz	rvanlieshout yes drop table migration could be used but what if you need a lot of data removed, i used to do just a drop in the past, saving time then rake db:schema:load

2013-11-25 13:46:30	epochwolf	jarr0dsz: refusing to drop a database when other people are connected to it is sane behavior.
2013-11-25 13:47:02	jarr0dsz	andrewvos my production database is only filled with test data easily rebuild, i made mayor refactoring to models so now just want to start with a fresh schema
2013-11-25 13:47:41	epochwolf	easy, stop the rails application, drop databaes
2013-11-25 13:47:41	jarr0dsz	without having to worry what to remove and what not, but its big headache indexes cannot be removed either with wildcard
2013-11-25 13:47:41	rvanlieshout	jarr0dsz: then just open a pg console and drop it from there
2013-11-25 13:47:54	rvanlieshout	how many times do you need to execute this?
2013-11-25 13:47:59	jarr0dsz	no that does not work, i dropped all tables from pg console but it will not drop all indexes
2013-11-25 13:48:05	rvanlieshout	then drop these too
2013-11-25 13:48:30	jarr0dsz	rvanlieshout ;p yes but there is no way to remove all indexes at once you need to explicit name them
2013-11-25 13:48:43	jarr0dsz	since i have around 50 indexes i dont like that, perhaps just drop db then ;s
2013-11-25 13:48:45	rvanlieshout	do you nee dto do this often?
2013-11-25 13:48:45	jarr0dsz	drop db and re-setup the user permission is faster
2013-11-25 13:48:47	rvanlieshout	need to do this often?
2013-11-25 13:48:53	jarr0dsz	rvanlieshout yes i need this often
2013-11-25 13:49:26	jarr0dsz	but perhaps need to work differently and write clean migrations
2013-11-25 13:49:26	epochwolf	lol
2013-11-25 13:49:57	rvanlieshout	make a shell script that lists all index and drop them?
2013-11-25 13:49:57	jarr0dsz	i only write up migration, i never take into consideration removing tables, feels like waste of time
2013-11-25 13:49:57	epochwolf	or just stop the application and drop teh database?
2013-11-25 13:49:57	rvanlieshout	i've never needed my down migration
2013-11-25 13:49:58	epochwolf	rvanlieshout: you've never needed a production rollback? You're lucky.
2013-11-25 13:50:17	rvanlieshout	epochwolf: i find fixing is faster then rollback + fixing

2013-11-26 15:09:07	mikecmpbll	haha.
2013-11-26 15:09:13	tobago	mikecmpbll, well that works as you expects it. but not with eager loading.
2013-11-26 15:09:19	mikecmpbll	indeed.
2013-11-26 15:09:31	tobago	mmh.
2013-11-26 15:09:53	mikecmpbll	adding complex conditions to associations was always buggy and still is quite buggy in rails 4
2013-11-26 15:10:00	omarqureshi	is this a common query?
2013-11-26 15:10:05	mikecmpbll	especially when you introduce preloading
2013-11-26 15:10:25	tobago	but that's the only point I'm interested in, because I'm talking about a collection.
2013-11-26 15:10:29	--	bphogan is now known as bphogan_afk
2013-11-26 15:10:40	omarqureshi	if its not, the way id do it is by pre-building everything, using a left join and just accessing any attributes that i need from the join
2013-11-26 15:10:52	omarqureshi	no include, just one nice query with a join.
2013-11-26 15:10:59	tobago	otherwise it will be expensive to load every log with its previous log alone.
2013-11-26 15:11:46	tobago	omarqureshi, alright. that will also work for me I guess, because I'm loading it once in my code.
2013-11-26 15:12:02	omarqureshi	include is fucking shit anyway
2013-11-26 15:12:08	omarqureshi	:<

2013-11-26 15:12:20	omarqureshi	i wouldnt, i'd use a left join
2013-11-26 15:12:27	omarqureshi	since you may not have the previous log
2013-11-26 15:12:32	rvanlieshout	left join is a massive speed downgrader
2013-11-26 15:12:34	omarqureshi	but still want to display
2013-11-26 15:12:36	tobago	right!
2013-11-26 15:12:37	rvanlieshout	then it's not possible indeed :)
2013-11-26 15:12:41	rvanlieshout	so only if possible
2013-11-26 15:12:51	tobago	a log also can have no previous log.

2013-11-26 15:13:31	mikecmpbll	couldn't you just have a parent_log_id field and a simple self-referential relationship
2013-11-26 15:13:42	omarqureshi	if this is a common query, you could package this up into a view
2013-11-26 15:13:57	omarqureshi	and have an activerecord object for the view

2013-11-26 15:19:23	mikecmpbll	technically i've never seen a reason why you shouldn't be able to eager load with class methods (scopes), then it would remove the necessity to shoehorn lots of complex conditions into associations
2013-11-26 15:19:49	omarqureshi	rails' eager loading is full of caveats

2013-11-27 18:40:59	jstrong	a better client side validations would be just JS based
2013-11-27 18:41:05	jstrong	with maybe some rails integration
2013-11-27 18:41:09	alx-	i think the best way is to use a json error response and show those errors on the form
2013-11-27 18:41:09	jstrong	but decoupled
2013-11-27 18:41:12	pothibo	jstrong agreed.
2013-11-27 18:41:21	jstrong	and that actually exists
2013-11-27 18:41:27	jstrong	i've used it and it's pretty good with some caveats
2013-11-27 18:41:37	alx-	that way all the validation happens on the server and js just displays the errors

2013-11-27 18:42:35	pothibo	If you do need to check against real validation do your JSON use FormData in JS and add a parameter like dry_run=true. In your create controller, check for that param if it exists, you don't save and just try for @obj.valid? and return error in JSON
2013-11-27 18:43:08	alx-	pothibo: good point
2013-11-27 18:44:11	pothibo	And yes, like jstrong said. JS validation should be light, I wouldn't make roundtrip to the server for validation. Take the basic ones like format with regex that can be light on the JS without HTTP Request.

2013-11-27 18:46:04	momomomomo	IE: If I have a blog, with many categories, and each category has a set of articles, and each article has comments
2013-11-27 18:46:14	pothibo	zeknox routing isn't linked to controller, those are 2 separate entities, Routing is mearly path parsing.

2013-11-27 18:47:17	jstrong	shallow nesting
2013-11-27 18:47:26	jstrong	shouldn't need more than one level,
2013-11-27 18:47:45	zeknox	so i read about shallow nesting, but I dont fully grasp the concept
2013-11-27 18:47:53	-->	w09x has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-11-27 18:47:57	jstrong	zeknox: you don't need the category id to find comments for an article
2013-11-27 18:48:06	jstrong	as long as you have the article id you can find the comments
2013-11-27 18:48:08	pothibo	zeknox shallow nesting is an alias
2013-11-27 18:48:08	zeknox	oh, now that sounds like hotness
2013-11-27 18:48:21	jstrong	so the categories/id part is practically dead weight
2013-11-27 18:48:36	<--	rwk1 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-11-27 18:48:42	zeknox	so if you don't specify an ID, how does it know which ID your talking about?
2013-11-27 18:48:46	jstrong	it doesn't
2013-11-27 18:48:56	jstrong	but article has category_id right?
2013-11-27 18:48:59	zeknox	its like the honeybadger? it doesn't give a shit?
2013-11-27 18:48:59	jstrong	so you can just grab it from there
2013-11-27 18:49:21	zeknox	ahhh, i c clearer now
2013-11-27 18:49:51	jstrong	unless it was many to many
2013-11-27 18:49:59	jstrong	in which case you would need both ids
2013-11-27 18:50:07	zeknox	making alot of sense now
2013-11-27 18:50:22	zeknox	other than many to many, are there situations where shallow nesting is not a wise idea?
2013-11-27 18:50:29	jstrong	i can't personally think of any

2013-11-28 14:57:37	Sylario	I have a model attribute that, if i had _text seems to display a value from a locales translation, is it from the rails i18n support or is there some translation gem at work?

2013-12-02 08:54:42	mkc	sevenseacat: To be perfectly honest i don't think any of the @imports work. I just realized that the fonts don't get loaded from the google cdn either
2013-12-02 08:54:42	sevenseacat	css @imports won't copy the file into your current file
2013-12-02 08:54:42	sevenseacat	they'll make another request for the extra file
2013-12-02 08:55:20	sevenseacat	especially for a remote URL, i wouldnt expect that to work

2013-12-02 08:56:32	luckyruby	sounds like your assets aren't being precompiled
2013-12-02 08:56:36	treehau55	basically to skip certain validations in my api controller I just subclassed the original model and got rid of the validations that were causing api calls to fail. Someone tell me this is either okay/crazy
2013-12-02 08:56:46	luckyruby	mkc: are you using capistrano?
2013-12-02 08:56:50	sevenseacat	treehau55: sounds like your validations are wrong.
2013-12-02 08:57:11	mkc	luckyruby: not using capistrano.
2013-12-02 08:57:17	luckyruby	mkc: rails 3 or 4

2013-12-02 08:57:28	mkc	luckyruby: rails 3
2013-12-02 08:57:31	mkc	3.
2013-12-02 08:57:33	mkc	3.2
2013-12-02 08:57:41	treehau55	sevenseacat, i would agree, but the way the model is set up, if its being created through the web interface, it will require a negative captcha, when your sending an api request, you are required to have a token, captcha is not needed
2013-12-02 08:58:09	sevenseacat	mkc: pretty sure imports are supposed to be at the top of the file.

2013-12-02 10:03:12	TJesse1	my noob question is how to display that text in html in my site/app? that is, how to take the output from scraper.rb and have it display on my site? so i can have a page that displays the scraped html. sorry it's my first day learning RoR.

2013-12-03 12:46:41	lxsameer	i have app/assets/templates   how can i force rails to copy templates in public in production ?
2013-12-03 12:47:10	elaptics	Evyr: well just use carrierwave or the proper paperclip and store them on the filesystem on the server - you can always move them into cloud storage later
2013-12-03 12:47:15	Evyr	@elaptics Do you have tips on a similar storage like amazon that works with Heroku?

2013-12-03 12:49:48	elaptics	and heroku isn't free - if you were to put images, etc in the database you'll quickly hit their paid tiers and the costs of those are waaaay more than amazon's measly storage costs

2013-12-03 13:01:29	Cambridge	basicallt the issue I've got is kaminari pagination is showing different amount of results per paginate page
2013-12-03 13:01:57	Cambridge	default is set to 14, the 1st page shows 14, page 2 shows 10 and page 3 shows 12
2013-12-03 13:02:04	workmad3	Cambridge: that usually indicates that you're filtering the result set down in ruby

2013-12-03 13:02:34	Cambridge	I've narrowed the issue down to this:    default_scope include: :reports, order: "reports.received_at ASC, vehicles.registration ASC" on the vehicle model

2013-12-03 13:03:09	Cambridge	if i remove the report bit out it paginates fine
2013-12-03 13:03:14	workmad3	Cambridge: don't do an 'include' on a default_scope

2013-12-03 14:44:58	universa1	unicode: yes, because a default application doesn't need it on heroku.

2013-12-03 16:35:08	ndee	I have a company which has several departments and I used rails g scaffold for company and department and now I try to get the normal CRUD functionality working. When I open the site/companies/1/departments/new, I get undefined method `departments_path' for #<#<Class:0x007fe15bc1fb30>:0x007fe15bc2fcd8>. I added the departments routes in the company block so the routes exist. What I don't understand is why that call is made in the first
2013-12-03 16:35:09	ndee	place. Shouldn't rails call the company_departments_path instead of the departments_path?

2013-12-03 17:31:15	DanBoy	i dunno then your code looks fine to me
2013-12-03 17:31:51	AntelopeSalad	each action is performing a role check , and then depending on the role you either see your projects / project details page -or- if you're an admin then you get redirected to the admin version of those pages
2013-12-03 17:32:03	AntelopeSalad	it just seems lame that i have to make a million role checks

2013-12-03 17:38:41	capitalist	hey, yeah - so it really sounds like a.add is not on the page
2013-12-03 17:38:56	capitalist	there is a way to override and make capybara select an invisible element - i think
2013-12-03 17:38:58	capitalist	one sec
2013-12-03 17:39:33	capitalist	so, try adding visible: false where you try to use a.add
2013-12-03 17:40:35	capitalist	peb7268: then you can at least tell if this is the problem

2013-12-03 17:41:06	elaptics	AntelopeSalad: seems like maybe you want a separate admin controller to do the admin things
2013-12-03 17:41:13	peb7268	That's just a css selector?
2013-12-03 17:41:19	peb7268	or a capybara setting?
2013-12-03 17:41:28	DanBoy	admin name space maybe?
2013-12-03 17:42:20	peb7268	like this right? page.all(".articles .article[id='foo']", :visible => false)

2013-12-03 17:44:32	AntelopeSalad	this role checking is more of a convinience factor for admins , this way if a non-admin links them to their project list , the admin will get redirected to the admin version of that page instead
2013-12-03 17:44:45	elaptics	AntelopeSalad: well from your snippet the obvious duplication is that if you're an admin do one thing otherwise do something else entirely
2013-12-03 17:44:51	-->	ddd has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-03 17:45:06	AntelopeSalad	elaptics: yeah, it just redirects admins to the admin version
2013-12-03 17:45:37	elaptics	AntelopeSalad: is the admin redirect defineable by a rule because then you could just do that in a before filter - like a guard clause
2013-12-03 17:45:49	elaptics	then the controller will be much less "conditional"
2013-12-03 17:46:01	-->	mallahan has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-03 17:46:02	AntelopeSalad	it's so that if let's say you were a user and you linked me to your foo.com/projects/3 list , when i as an admin view it, i'll get redirected to foo.com/dashboard/projects/3
2013-12-03 17:46:07	-->	jcromart_ has joined #RubyOnRails

2013-12-03 17:47:41	AntelopeSalad	ah, so i would use 2 before filters
2013-12-03 17:47:55	AntelopeSalad	(i already use one to load some resources)
2013-12-03 17:48:16	AntelopeSalad	the thing is tho, depending on what action you hit, the redirect is different
2013-12-03 17:48:37	DanBoy	whats in params
2013-12-03 17:48:43	DanBoy	check that then do some logic on it
2013-12-03 17:49:18	AntelopeSalad	the permit params? it's empty because this controller only handles index/show
2013-12-03 17:49:23	<--	DaniG2k has quit (Quit: leaving)
2013-12-03 17:49:27	elaptics	AntelopeSalad: that's why I asked if there's a logic to it, you just need to encode that in the check - or create a little class that deals with detemining that if it means more than a couple of lines method in the controller
2013-12-03 17:49:48	-->	DaniG2k has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-03 17:51:14	AntelopeSalad	so this before filter needs to determine which action was requested?
2013-12-03 17:51:34	momomomomo	def admin_redirect; if current_user.is? :admin; redirect_to dashboard_url, action: controller.action; end;
2013-12-03 17:52:52	-->	RobertBirnie has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-03 17:52:55	momomomomo	obviously, dashboard_url could vary if you've got nested resources like you showed
2013-12-03 17:53:14	mallahan	On the heroku cedar stack, is there a setting required to get images to precompile? Other assets seem fine.
2013-12-03 17:53:31	AntelopeSalad	momomomomo: but the dashboard_url needs to be different for index and show tho
2013-12-03 17:53:36	-->	vanstee_ has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-03 17:53:40	AntelopeSalad	or does the action: controller.action magically somehow handle that?
2013-12-03 17:53:46	-->	jkamenik has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-03 17:54:03	momomomomo	controller.action == 'index' ? my_dashboard_index_path : my_dashboard_other_path
2013-12-03 17:54:09	momomomomo	or however you want to handle it - just define a helper ?
2013-12-03 17:54:16	momomomomo	elaptics: you jiggly with that?
2013-12-03 17:54:19	momomomomo	jiggy*

2013-12-03 17:54:42	<--	phansch has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2013-12-03 17:54:55	AntelopeSalad	so then i trade some logic duplication vs a multi-method abstraction?
2013-12-03 17:55:01	-->	ecnalyr has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-03 17:55:10	elaptics	or maybe polymorphic_path might work
2013-12-03 17:55:38	elaptics	polymorphic_path(:dashboard, @project)
2013-12-03 17:55:47	elaptics	not tested, could be totally wrong :)
2013-12-03 17:55:59	momomomomo	elaptics: brilliant - I didn't know about polymorphic path

2013-12-03 17:56:21	elaptics	momomomomo: it's pretty useful - I use it quite often
2013-12-03 17:56:28	momomomomo	I could have been using that for a long time now
2013-12-03 17:56:31	elaptics	always have to look up signature in the docs :)
2013-12-03 17:56:38	momomomomo	me gusta that
2013-12-03 17:56:54	AntelopeSalad	i'm not seeing how that helps here

2013-12-03 17:57:19	AntelopeSalad	i thought polymorphic_path was to build paths for poly associations
2013-12-03 17:57:34	momomomomo	nope, think of polymorphic as meaning 'multiple definitions'
2013-12-03 17:57:38	momomomomo	rather than being linked to an association
2013-12-03 17:57:41	elaptics	AntelopeSalad: like rails other helpers which infers paths from the object, and just modifying it with the extra namespace
2013-12-03 17:58:21	momomomomo	basically it takes your inputs, and rails-magically outputs the assumed path based on the object arguments - read the examples on http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/PolymorphicRoutes.html

2013-12-03 22:02:56	shinobi_one	so what is the difference between that and mine? :P
2013-12-03 22:03:01	bricker	shinobi_one: when you use form builder, the object is implied. That example is showing how to use the `select` helper without form builder
2013-12-03 22:03:08	shinobi_one	ah gotcha that makes sense
2013-12-03 22:03:47	shinobi_one	which is silly because the Module is ActionView::Helpers::FormOptionsHelper, so you would think the examples would be more relevant to what you're doing with it

2013-12-04 09:25:30	tboerger	...without a fucking slowly recursive function
2013-12-04 09:25:49	Demerzel	wouldn't be recursive - iterative should work here

2013-12-04 09:32:12	Demerzel	the one liner is quicker to write but more difficult for the compiler to optimize
2013-12-04 09:32:32	Demerzel	the advantage might not be significant

2013-12-04 09:54:02	ziikutv	So from Dota2/Steam servers I can use GetMatchHistory which is used to get a list of matches played (I can also add various options to the url to give me latest matches played by a particular account, but i don't think thats needed). From there I can get match IDs which I can use n GetMatchDetails to get match details such as who played what heroes, and how they did in the game.

2013-12-04 10:03:14	sevenseacat	after you install postgres, it's exactly the same ease of use to use it than it is to use sqlite, with none of the downsides

2013-12-04 10:18:01	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I don't expect you to study ALL ruby
2013-12-04 10:18:02	luckyruby	i recommend project euler for learning ruby
2013-12-04 10:18:20	Fire-Dragon-DoL	but you should definitely know enough of it to not struggle with syntax
2013-12-04 10:18:22	pontiki	besides the old pickaxe book, i picked up "Ruby for Rails" which was quite good at the time, i thought
2013-12-04 10:18:36	pontiki	project euler for learning any language!
2013-12-04 10:18:43	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I have radar book which I like a lot
2013-12-04 10:18:49	Fire-Dragon-DoL	he is much more nice in book xD
2013-12-04 10:18:55	pontiki	you can do ruby koans in other languages too
2013-12-04 10:19:01	Fire-Dragon-DoL	koans?
2013-12-04 10:19:02	pontiki	but not with the feedback

2013-12-04 10:20:26	Fire-Dragon-DoL	usually all algorithms you need are already in the language (sorting and such things), most complex algorithms require maths people

2013-12-04 10:20:29	Fire-Dragon-DoL	it's not true
2013-12-04 10:20:38	Fire-Dragon-DoL	in Rails the most important part is learn to organize code

2013-12-04 10:23:55	Fire-Dragon-DoL	ddd: it returned me a lot of errors first time, but maybe was the SSD faulty, dunno

2013-12-04 10:24:14	luckyruby	to be fair, rvm does have its warts

2013-12-04 10:27:08	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I imagine something huge

2013-12-04 10:27:19	pontiki	ok, how huge is "huge"?
2013-12-04 10:27:25	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I have no idea how big but I've noticed on very simple code I don't use common design patterns anymore
2013-12-04 10:27:38	Fire-Dragon-DoL	which I heared are really important on big companies with big projects
2013-12-04 10:27:47	Fire-Dragon-DoL	ddd: good night
2013-12-04 10:27:48	pontiki	ah
2013-12-04 10:27:57	Fire-Dragon-DoL	for example in a very small gem
2013-12-04 10:28:00	pontiki	i think that's a fallacy actually
2013-12-04 10:28:06	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I've built, I've done a very stupid
2013-12-04 10:28:31	Fire-Dragon-DoL	case "link tag" "script tag" "img tag"
2013-12-04 10:28:41	Fire-Dragon-DoL	which from a coding organization standpoint, is quite bad
2013-12-04 10:28:42	pontiki	i'd be willing to bet that even in your tiny little gem, there are design patterns

2013-12-04 10:28:47	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I should have written 3 classes =P
2013-12-04 10:29:03	Fire-Dragon-DoL	oh I don't mean there aren't design patterns but
2013-12-04 10:29:17	<--	cdownard has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2013-12-04 10:29:17	pontiki	the difference being perhaps, recognizing what patterns might work best in a specific implementation
2013-12-04 10:29:27	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I transformed something that required 3 files and 3 classes to be "pattern-correct" into a 6 lines code which is not
2013-12-04 10:29:33	Fire-Dragon-DoL	but indeed the gem is small so I didn't care
2013-12-04 10:29:45	pontiki	but if it's what is needed
2013-12-04 10:29:47	pontiki	and it works
2013-12-04 10:30:00	pontiki	and is easily extended and maintainable
2013-12-04 10:30:12	Fire-Dragon-DoL	well, it works is ok, i'm not sure if in huge projects "it works" is ok enough :P
2013-12-04 10:30:15	pontiki	that's better than havign strict adherence to a particular design pattern

2013-12-04 10:30:21	pontiki	pfft
2013-12-04 10:30:23	Fire-Dragon-DoL	"problem" is with ruby
2013-12-04 10:30:27	Fire-Dragon-DoL	you can hack everything
2013-12-04 10:30:31	Fire-Dragon-DoL	so it's not really that hard xD
2013-12-04 10:30:58	Fire-Dragon-DoL	(consider I love the hacking feature of ruby, for me every language should support the amount of reflection/rewrite/anything ruby does)
2013-12-04 10:31:17	pontiki	there has been an awful lot of deification of the concept of design patterns
2013-12-04 10:31:23	pontiki	and a lot of glamourization of same
2013-12-04 10:31:27	rvanlieshout	i would choose maintanable over less lines
2013-12-04 10:31:31	pontiki	not that they are not quite useful
2013-12-04 10:31:41	dseitz	design patterns are just tools, don't necessarily equate to good code
2013-12-04 10:31:54	dseitz	you can use a popular design pattern and end up with crap

2013-12-04 10:32:38	pontiki	they never remove the need to think about what you're doing
2013-12-04 10:32:38	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I don't know, never did such a big project I suppose
2013-12-04 10:32:41	dseitz	You'd be surprised how irrelevant TDD is in a lot of businesses for instance
2013-12-04 10:32:47	dseitz	but we read about it all over the ruby world
2013-12-04 10:33:02	Fire-Dragon-DoL	TDD doesn't exist usually in compiled code
2013-12-04 10:33:11	pontiki	wut?
2013-12-04 10:33:22	pontiki	what's comiled/interprettd have to do with it?

2013-12-04 10:33:28	Fire-Dragon-DoL	nothing
2013-12-04 10:33:31	Fire-Dragon-DoL	just less common

2013-12-04 10:33:37	pontiki	less common, yes
2013-12-04 10:33:41	dseitz	It's a mess; I'm given a spec sheet and that is it
2013-12-04 10:33:49	Fire-Dragon-DoL	while writing java/c/c++ no one ever told me "ehy you know that TDD exist?"
2013-12-04 10:33:55	pontiki	but TDD arose out of the ruby world, so it's going to be more common there
2013-12-04 10:34:09	rvanlieshout	Fire-Dragon-DoL: don't blame those languages for that
2013-12-04 10:34:10	Fire-Dragon-DoL	C# has some support for it
2013-12-04 10:34:13	pontiki	that's a social phenomenon, not a technical one
2013-12-04 10:34:25	Fire-Dragon-DoL	rvanlieshout: not blaming languages, blaming people from that languages that never told me such a thing
2013-12-04 10:34:38	Fire-Dragon-DoL	rvanlieshout: really, I've thousands books and not a single one mentioned tdd

2013-12-04 10:34:55	rvanlieshout	i don't think that is related to the language, but more to the community
2013-12-04 10:34:56	Fire-Dragon-DoL	and after knowing tdd now I really want it everywhere
2013-12-04 10:35:01	pontiki	holy cow, even i don't have thousands of tech books
2013-12-04 10:35:07	Fire-Dragon-DoL	expecially because avoids me running (for example) browser while coding
2013-12-04 10:35:14	rvanlieshout	this is an active community and TDD is just something that didn't really exist 20 years ago
2013-12-04 10:35:19	lamaster	how can i use serializer without render method?

2013-12-04 10:35:56	Fire-Dragon-DoL	for me
2013-12-04 10:36:04	Fire-Dragon-DoL	the most cool thing in tdd
2013-12-04 10:36:16	Fire-Dragon-DoL	was "mounting" a dummy rails app for your tests

2013-12-04 10:36:41	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I came from php where the webserver was handled by apache, so you can't "mount" php code somewhere, with rails you can xD
2013-12-04 10:36:53	Fire-Dragon-DoL	qa engineering?
2013-12-04 10:36:58	rvanlieshout	using TDD doesn't mean you should drop QA engineers
2013-12-04 10:36:59	pontiki	but even way back then, the idea we had of writing down how the features should work in code was a thing
2013-12-04 10:37:17	lamaster	rvanlieshout: what should i do? I have to send same data but via SSE, so i have to make same array of data
2013-12-04 10:37:27	rvanlieshout	Fire-Dragon-DoL: quality assurance
2013-12-04 10:37:38	Fire-Dragon-DoL	rvanlieshout: oh ok
2013-12-04 10:37:42	pontiki	rvanlieshout: that wasn't the point i was going for, but yeah
2013-12-04 10:37:44	rvanlieshout	lamaster: what is SSE? what have you tried?
2013-12-04 10:38:08	rvanlieshout	pontiki: i know, but just to spill out that quality is more then just tdd
2013-12-04 10:38:13	Fire-Dragon-DoL	the biggest downsides in TDD at the moment is that sometimes you write bugs instead of tdd
2013-12-04 10:38:18	Fire-Dragon-DoL	and that's a huge problem
2013-12-04 10:38:33	Fire-Dragon-DoL	maybe there should be a set of default tests ? Dunno
2013-12-04 10:38:41	pontiki	that's as much a problem for post-hoc test writing , Fire-Dragon-DoL
2013-12-04 10:38:42	Fire-Dragon-DoL	I try to keep those around 2-3 lines of code
2013-12-04 10:38:44	rvanlieshout	Fire-Dragon-DoL: that's not a problem.. bugs happen.
2013-12-04 10:39:00	pontiki	simple tests are best

2013-12-04 11:28:52	Fire-Dragon-DoL	okay and now the biggest problem
2013-12-04 11:28:58	Fire-Dragon-DoL	which I still didn't find a solution about
2013-12-04 11:29:01	Fire-Dragon-DoL	what if
2013-12-04 11:29:07	Fire-Dragon-DoL	someone update your personal record
2013-12-04 11:29:25	Fire-Dragon-DoL	but you want to keep all your old MembershipCards (you get a new one every year)
2013-12-04 11:29:33	Fire-Dragon-DoL	with the "old" personal record data?
2013-12-04 11:30:10	rvanlieshout	if you don't need that data that often you could use something like paper_trail
2013-12-04 11:30:33	 *	Fire-Dragon-DoL check what paper_trail does

2013-12-04 11:30:40	workmad3	that's an option... or rather than updating a PersonalRecord, each time an update comes in you create a new one and link back to the previous one
2013-12-04 11:31:07	workmad3	the cards maintain a link to the PersonalRecord they were created against
2013-12-04 11:31:34	Fire-Dragon-DoL	yes this was my second choice

2013-12-04 11:31:47	Fire-Dragon-DoL	but it was harder to find out in a single query
2013-12-04 11:31:55	workmad3	with that said, is this really a feature that's desired? I personally wouldn't expect some membership cards to keep history like that :)
2013-12-04 11:31:57	Fire-Dragon-DoL	which is the lates
2013-12-04 11:32:22	workmad3	yeah, to find that out in a single query, you'd probably need to delve into CTEs
2013-12-04 11:32:23	Fire-Dragon-DoL	well it happens more often than you can think of
2013-12-04 11:32:38	Fire-Dragon-DoL	my first implementation was done when I was 15, that was insanely hard for me xD

2013-12-04 11:34:33	workmad3	another option... when a card is issued, and the current PersonalRecord has a card of that type, create a new PersonalRecord

2013-12-04 11:34:38	-->	kek has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-04 11:34:43	workmad3	link that back to previous ones
2013-12-04 11:34:50	workmad3	and when updates come in, update the current one
2013-12-04 11:35:20	rvanlieshout	you can get the latest with one query
2013-12-04 11:35:23	Fire-Dragon-DoL	mh good option too
2013-12-04 11:35:32	workmad3	that way, you have 1 PersonalRecord per year (I'm guessing you don't care about finer granularity updates?)
2013-12-04 11:35:32	Fire-Dragon-DoL	anyway papertrail seems quite good
2013-12-04 11:35:37	Fire-Dragon-DoL	but loooks really slow xD
2013-12-04 11:36:12	rvanlieshout	in postgres use distinct on (id) membership.* and order by id desc.. for mysql drop the on(id) part
2013-12-04 11:36:14	workmad3	and yeah, the latest one is always a single query to find... it's just getting the entire history out that would be harder :)
2013-12-04 11:36:52	workmad3	PersonalRecord.order_by("created_at DESC").first
2013-12-04 11:36:53	rvanlieshout	that should give you the first result of each membership.. euhm.. distinct on user_id that is then
2013-12-04 11:37:02	-->	senayar has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-04 11:37:06	workmad3	limited to a user id there :)
2013-12-04 11:37:17	rvanlieshout	PersonalRecord.select('DISTINCT ON (user_id) memberships.*).order_by("created_at DESC")
2013-12-04 11:37:24	rvanlieshout	1 per user
2013-12-04 11:37:24	workmad3	^^ that one
2013-12-04 11:37:31	rvanlieshout	in postgres
2013-12-04 11:37:55	rvanlieshout	mysql use distinct(memberships.user_id), other_membership_columns
2013-12-04 11:38:05	-->	ldnunes has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-04 11:38:21	workmad3	that's assuming there is a separate user_id anyway (which would be a really useful thing to have, and also make sense for the account/profile split mentioned earlier :) )
2013-12-04 11:39:40	workmad3	you can also do 'has_one :current_record, class_name: "PersonalRecord", order: "created_at DESC" ' as an association to have 'current_record' always point at the latest PersonalRecord ;)
2013-12-04 11:39:49	Fire-Dragon-DoL	workmad3: well I'll never need the entire history, I just need MembershipCard => Correct personal_record version
2013-12-04 11:39:55	Fire-Dragon-DoL	it should be transparent
2013-12-04 11:40:18	Fire-Dragon-DoL	mhhh and if they want to edit an old record? they are obviously doing something wrong xD
2013-12-04 11:40:35	workmad3	Fire-Dragon-DoL: well, I was thinking 'get the entire history out without a grouping user_id field' anyway, tracking through the previous versions
2013-12-04 11:41:07	workmad3	Fire-Dragon-DoL: with a user_id grouping them together, it's simple anyway (and you'd likely want/need to grab them out just to get the historical card data)
2013-12-04 11:41:07	Fire-Dragon-DoL	ah ok
2013-12-04 11:41:27	Fire-Dragon-DoL	thanks a lot anyway
2013-12-04 11:41:51	Fire-Dragon-DoL	papertrail looks too big

2013-12-04 11:49:45	sjuxax	Hi all. I need to iteratively assemble a query in Rails outside of methods that call ActiveRecord directly (like where), like "WHERE id IS NOT ? AND id IS NOT ? AND id IS NOT ? ..." What's the best way to do this?

2013-12-04 11:50:29	rvanlieshout	outside methods that call activerecord?
2013-12-04 11:50:35	rvanlieshout	because?
2013-12-04 11:51:08	jarr0dsz	tied that workmad its not on 10 seconds, also increased the pool. I digg the logs more perhaps something shows up or i need to modify log level
2013-12-04 11:51:17	sjuxax	I guess it doesn't _have_ to be that way, it just seems like it would, because I would need to loop to build that string.
2013-12-04 11:51:35	sjuxax	or prepare another structure that I can send to where(), etc., which may be best
2013-12-04 11:51:44	rvanlieshout	sjuxax: why not call .where!("id <> ?", x") each time?
2013-12-04 11:51:50	rvanlieshout	note the ! after the where
2013-12-04 11:52:17	rvanlieshout	the ! replaces the object itself, so calling it again would add a condition
2013-12-04 11:52:28	-->	nhhagen has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-04 11:53:00	sjuxax	that's ideal if I can control it so that the actual query isn't sent until all elements have accumulated
2013-12-04 11:53:10	workmad3	sjuxax: that's exactly what happens
2013-12-04 11:53:27	rvanlieshout	it won't perform the query unless you try to access the data

2013-12-04 11:58:59	workmad3	sjuxax: no, that's because you're in the console

2013-12-04 17:28:03	Lann	maybe i'm thinking of it wrong
2013-12-04 17:28:07	momomomomo	Would make sense to store those for any actively logged in users
2013-12-04 17:28:27	Lann	but redis persists itself to disk right?
2013-12-04 17:28:42	momomomomo	and have a callback on the model in rails to temporarily persist the data in Redis after_commit; and, to delete the record when a user signs out / is inactive
2013-12-04 17:28:43	Lann	i'm wondering if i should keep the whole activerecord user.character at all

2013-12-04 17:29:43	enape_101	momomomomo, my self.down drop_table :events will drop the indices as well, correct?
2013-12-04 17:30:15	Lann	so i can still store them in mysql but i can make all modifications/reads just go to redis
2013-12-04 17:30:17	momomomomo	just use def change, and let AR handle it

2013-12-04 17:38:36	momomomomo	Lann: Right, you could do that - there are many ways to skin this cat
2013-12-04 17:38:43	momomomomo	Lann: You could do model caching with memcached / dalli
2013-12-04 17:39:03	Lann	that could possibly be simpler as then can't i just use normal rails associations?
2013-12-04 17:39:09	momomomomo	yep.

2013-12-04 17:44:04	momomomomo	Lann: I'm sure there are other resources - look at Dalli
2013-12-04 17:44:22	omarqureshi	dalli is just a memcached adaptor that does failovers
2013-12-04 17:45:03	momomomomo	omarqureshi: No shit?
2013-12-04 17:45:15	omarqureshi	the deal is, you use redis for performance, however if your query is fast enough, then does it matter?

2013-12-04 17:46:09	momomomomo	omarqureshi: Using memcached will eliminate the issue outright, for the time being, while allowing caches to prevent multiple hits to the database
2013-12-04 17:46:20	momomomomo	omarqureshi: and eliminate the need to write any redid-specific code

2013-12-04 17:46:34	omarqureshi	you can surely have a redis adaptor for model caching
2013-12-04 17:46:50	momomomomo	why would you, when memcached + dalli is a well documented & excellent resolution
2013-12-04 17:47:07	momomomomo	especially when combined with the fact that it adds little to no overhead in development time to plug in
2013-12-04 17:47:17	omarqureshi	who knows
2013-12-04 17:47:19	omarqureshi	its an option.
2013-12-04 17:47:46	omarqureshi	a similar option to memcached, albeit not as great with failovers
2013-12-04 17:47:50	Lann	yeah i'm reading up on dalli
2013-12-04 17:48:04	Lann	most of the memcache things focus on caching heh
2013-12-04 17:48:20	jragon	I'm having trouble with Acts_as_list. I get a no method error. Here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/Jragon/7777049
2013-12-04 17:48:52	Lann	when i really just want it as storage that is accessible between threads
2013-12-04 17:49:14	omarqureshi	both memcached and redis are just KV stores
2013-12-04 17:49:36	Lann	well yeah but i assume dalli will hide me from that fact with memcache
2013-12-04 17:49:58	omarqureshi	not any more than the memcache gem
2013-12-04 17:50:06	omarqureshi	it will just deal with failovers
2013-12-04 17:50:10	omarqureshi	theres too much shit going on here
2013-12-04 17:50:14	omarqureshi	what do you ACTUALLY want?
2013-12-04 17:50:20	momomomomo	omarqureshi: It's simple
2013-12-04 17:50:24	momomomomo	There are attributes which change on a user
2013-12-04 17:50:37	omarqureshi	you know, databases cache too
2013-12-04 17:50:37	momomomomo	Those attributes should not have to wait for a SQL write to be accessible to other users
2013-12-04 17:50:48	momomomomo	omarqureshi: True, but wait until you've read the spec
2013-12-04 17:51:00	-->	mehlah has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-04 17:51:04	momomomomo	also, their caching is not enough for jobs like this, which you probably know
2013-12-04 17:51:09	Lann	momo: yeah that more or less accurately describes it

2013-12-04 17:51:29	momomomomo	So, then we got into the discussion about writing to redis first
2013-12-04 17:51:45	-->	jsullivandigs has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-04 17:51:54	omarqureshi	so, write performance is a problem with databases - for sure
2013-12-04 17:51:55	Lann	somebody told me to use redis but then as i got into the implementation i am like fighting with activerecord vs redis
2013-12-04 17:52:06	momomomomo	then, Lann settled on the fact that, well, maybe a few sql writes isn't too much to do before sharing the attribute value - and if the data is cached afterwards, it should be fine
2013-12-04 17:52:53	omarqureshi	so, you really want to write to both, maybe
2013-12-04 17:52:53	momomomomo	I think I'd go with memcached / dalli just for the sheer ease and performance jump, and, when SQL writes scale higher, I'd consider  looking into writing more complex code

2013-12-04 17:53:15	momomomomo	omarqureshi: maybe down the line, but for the moment, i'd recommend just memcached / dalli to prevent over optimization
2013-12-04 17:53:18	diegoviola	hi
2013-12-04 17:53:20	omarqureshi	you cant trust memcached or redis to be your source of truth
2013-12-04 17:53:30	diegoviola	i'm trying to access some constant from the model to the view, and i can't, any ideas how to do this?
2013-12-04 17:53:31	omarqureshi	it depends on how much you care about the source of truth.
2013-12-04 17:53:33	Lann	imagine a chat server like irc, but with every line of text the user needs to check some value about another user. that's more or less the situation
2013-12-04 17:53:45	momomomomo	omarqureshi: Dude, you're killing me
2013-12-04 17:53:50	momomomomo	omarqureshi: I'm saying trust SQL as source of truth

2013-12-04 17:54:56	omarqureshi	theyre not, you're talking about dalli and memcached like theyre two different things

2013-12-04 17:57:11	momomomomo	Lann: omarqureshi To be clear - this is my suggestion: Use dalli and memcached (two different things, working in tandem to cache your stuff) and model caching as described in that railscast to handle this. If you find your postgresql (if you're using this) writes get heavy and bogged down, check out http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Tuning_Your_PostgreSQL_Server - failing that, I'd then consider writing something more complex.

2013-12-04 21:40:11	blahzay	Hi Everyone.  Is it possible to use database specific functions on relation conditions?  For instance I have a belongs_to :app, :foreign_key => 'app_identifier', :primary_key => 'context'.   The problem is I need to use the postgres "replace" function on that foreign key.  Essentially I need belongs_to app, :foreign_key => "replace(events.context, 'com.someidentifier.', '')", :primary_key => "context"
2013-12-04 21:40:21	r08o	Let's say I want to make a service on my RoR application that used a rest call from another website and returns "something" or  "something else" depending on the content of the rest call from the other site.
2013-12-04 21:40:21	r08o	How do I best represent this in RoR? I could easily just make the check directly in a partial view, but I don't think that is the best practice.﻿

2013-12-06 09:13:39	sevenseacat	compare where you're calling the datepicker and where youre calling the timepicker

2013-12-06 09:26:09	tobago	btw. the rails console to_yaml did what I expected.
2013-12-06 09:26:29	sevenseacat	enape_101: the form doesn't know. in the JS you're telling the plugin which fields to set.
2013-12-06 09:26:54	sevenseacat	you're telling the same field to be a datepicker and a timepicker.
2013-12-06 09:27:02	sevenseacat	it cant be both.
2013-12-06 09:27:21	enape_101	exactly, that's the main issue

2013-12-06 14:57:37	FooBarWidget	there are slight performance benefits, but in the end you're mostly limited by the resources that heroku gives you

2013-12-06 15:02:45	-->	Lewis has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-06 15:02:46	FooBarWidget	CPU, memory
2013-12-06 15:02:54	FooBarWidget	those are the hard limits
2013-12-06 15:03:15	nicolaas	Well, you get what you pay for… I guess?
2013-12-06 15:03:21	rvanlieshout	nicolaas: worry about your own app more
2013-12-06 15:03:26	rvanlieshout	about how you use the database
2013-12-06 15:03:37	FooBarWidget	passenger does a few things a bit better than unicorn. for example passenger comes with an nginx core that buffers your requests/responses, while unicorn does not do that and in fact requires a buffering layer
2013-12-06 15:03:37	rvanlieshout	it's most likely way more important fo get speed benefits there
2013-12-06 15:03:53	FooBarWidget	this buffering layer that passenger provides protects the app against slow clients
2013-12-06 15:04:30	FooBarWidget	passenger also provides a better out-of-band garbage collection implementation than unicorn. out-of-band garbage collection allows you to decrease your response times by garbage collecting in between requests.
2013-12-06 15:04:52	FooBarWidget	however, with unicorn, you could end up in a situation where all your unicorn workers are garbage collecting, this negates the advantages of the feature
2013-12-06 15:05:03	FooBarWidget	passenger fixes this by ensuring only 1 process is GC'ing at a time
2013-12-06 15:05:13	-->	csaunders has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-06 15:05:26	nicolaas	So basically, its just better?
2013-12-06 15:05:45	FooBarWidget	well I'm the author, so I like to think so
2013-12-06 15:06:09	rvanlieshout	:)

2013-12-06 15:13:28	ddd	FooBarWidget: hmm, will have to check if passenger standalone supports RVM (and per project rvmrc files, which means multiple different rubies). Last time I ran passenger (this was at least a year ago) that was problematic
2013-12-06 15:13:37	FooBarWidget	it does

2013-12-06 15:14:47	ddd	yeah, thats a definite need. if can do so without the need to use reverse proxy mode, i'd be willing to switch to passenger again from unicorn
2013-12-06 15:15:19	FooBarWidget	and there's also node.js support and meteor support, if you happen to use that too
2013-12-06 15:15:19	ddd	unicorn and reverse proxying just makes it more complicated than I feel it needs to be

But I need wiki_path('foo') => /wiki/foo. If I mount it as `wiki(/:xxx)` I get the oathe helper I need, but now Gollum just runs at `wiki/foo` i.e. it doesn't pass foo as the path to Sinatra. Anyone explain correct way to do this?

2013-12-08 15:37:54	rushed	enricostn: right, so that would be in the create action for the GroupsController then, which leaves you a ton of options... you could poke at the params (or the result of the groups_params call) before the call to Group.new (they're just hashes) or poke at the objects after, or inject the current user directly to the model and let it do the work on a before/after save, etc, etc

2013-12-08 16:10:35	AntelopeSalad	for example, let's say you require a phone number and first/last name in your rails validations, would you bother to put null false on those columns?

2013-12-08 17:32:06	droptone	question, if anyone is awake this fine Sunday morning. Using the Devise built-in methods, my current_user.type is returning "Artist" whether I'm an Artist or Fan
2013-12-08 17:32:25	droptone	I have an Artist model and Fan model that inherit from the root User model via STA and works fine
2013-12-08 17:32:28	droptone	STI*

2013-12-08 17:33:09	droptone	when I use rails console, if I execute say, user = Fan.first, then user.type
2013-12-08 17:33:14	droptone	it returns "Fan" properly
2013-12-08 17:33:33	droptone	however, when I log in with that exact user, current_user.type returns "Artist"
2013-12-08 17:33:57	droptone	wondering if anyone has ever experienced anything simliar working with Devise while using models that inherit via STI?
2013-12-08 17:35:16	universa1	droptone: a bit unrelated: but couldn't an artist also be a fan of another artist?

2013-12-08 17:36:23	droptone	universa1: Devise is set up using the base User model, and Artist < User, and Fan < User
2013-12-08 17:36:29	droptone	we're using STI
2013-12-08 17:36:35	droptone	and it works great so far

2013-12-08 20:15:39	-->	RoryHughes has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-08 20:15:41	AntelopeSalad	you would have a deleted_at or similar column on your model as a datetime
2013-12-08 20:15:55	AntelopeSalad	then on delete, you post the time of deletion instead of actually deleting it
2013-12-08 20:15:58	goofyballs789748	Right, you think the API at http://api.rubyonrails.org/ is a good user reference?
2013-12-08 20:16:33	goofyballs789748	It is presented in a way that makes the project feel about 10X more complicated than it actually is

2013-12-08 20:16:47	goofyballs789748	Where is the User API then?
2013-12-08 20:17:07	ddd	there is no 'user' api. what the dvelopers create is for the users.
2013-12-08 20:17:22	AntelopeSalad	goofyballs789748: try http://guides.rubyonrails.org
2013-12-08 20:17:24	ddd	everything you mention is for the developers. including the guides. Rails is a developer tool, not a user tool

2013-12-08 20:18:09	goofyballs789748	That is the problem, people who use Rails shouldn't need to have to Sift through the entire source code to use the tool, how useful would jQuery be if you needed to read its source to understand it? It is Abstracted-
2013-12-08 20:18:36	ddd	AntelopeSalad: hmm, first thing that came to mind was 'what happens if the timestamp gets messed up, or say the wrong one stored due to erroneously configured timezones? Where's the protection for the data?
2013-12-08 20:19:15	ddd	goofyballs789748: quit your bitching. there are enough docs, guides, tutorials, etc just offered at the main website that dumpster diving the actual source code is NOT needed.

2013-12-08 20:19:42	ddd	you do THAT when there's some sort of real difficulty
2013-12-08 20:20:04	ddd	goofyballs789748: which is exactly why rails is so popular. Because they don't do that and you're just trolling.

2013-12-08 21:20:49	toretore	AntelopeSalad: the answer lies in a part of your code that you didn't gist

2013-12-08 21:23:04	helpa	AntelopeSalad: Clearly explain what is happening and create a Gist (http://gist.github.com) or Pastie (http://pastie.org) of the code that is causing the problem you are encountering, as well as any useful output like stacktraces. A "Full Trace" as opposed to the default "Application Trace" is preferred. NO FAKE CODE. If you're under an NDA, we cannot help you with your problem. Go hire a consultant.
2013-12-08 21:23:13	AntelopeSalad	ok
2013-12-08 21:23:29	AntelopeSalad	so which file do i need to include?
2013-12-08 21:23:30	ddd	AntelopeSalad: and he's right, the problem is probably in the main edit.html.erb not the little snippet you'r eincluding
2013-12-08 21:23:46	@Radar	AntelopeSalad: You're not doing @employee.build_account in the new action of your controller.

2013-12-08 21:34:04	ddd	like if spec/controllers/*_spec.rb fail, but you change spec/features/somefile.rb it notices but instead of running *that* file, it runs the failed controller tests only until you 'reload rspec' in guard console?

2013-12-08 23:01:12	morenoh149	is it a good idea to still use jquery-rails?
2013-12-08 23:01:24	morenoh149	how do make it use jquery 2.0?
2013-12-08 23:01:30	treehau55	if you want to use jquery, I don't see why not
2013-12-08 23:02:31	morenoh149	I'm getting confused because there is a 3.0 version of the gem, but I thought the gem's version number was in lockstep with the jquery versions
2013-12-08 23:02:46	treehau55	nope

2013-12-08 23:03:26	imkmf	morenoh149: ask @indirect, he's the maintainer of the gem (not sure if he's on here, on twitter though)
2013-12-08 23:03:44	morenoh149	and the gem's readme says nothing as far as rails 4 so I'm lost
2013-12-08 23:04:12	treehau55	the readme says Rails 3.1 or later

2013-12-08 23:05:15	morenoh149	whoops
2013-12-08 23:05:17	treehau55	morenoh149, I am not 100% positive as I haven't tried this, but done it with similar gems ( the angular js gem) you can just locate the gem, and go inside the asset folder, and swap out the assets files for the newest versions
2013-12-08 23:06:08	treehau55	the best solution would be for you to fork it though in case you had other people working on your project and in your gemfile make sure to point to your version of the gem with jquery 2.0
2013-12-08 23:06:33	jrobeson	morenoh149, do you care about ie8 ?
2013-12-08 23:06:39	morenoh149	yeah found this https://github.com/rails/jquery-rails/blob/master/VERSIONS.md apparently it's never gone to jquery 2.0
2013-12-08 23:06:54	jrobeson	because a lot of poeple still want to support ie8
2013-12-08 23:07:12	jrobeson	the jquery that is in jquery-rails is the same features as jquery 2.* versions just with older browser support
2013-12-08 23:07:13	treehau55	morenoh149,  correct, because jquery 2.0 breaks ie8 support. jquery is still releasing 1.x updates
2013-12-08 23:07:52	treehau55	morenoh149,  like with all things gem related, I guarantee there is a similar gem, with jquery 2.0
2013-12-08 23:07:53	morenoh149	I just wanted to get rid of an error on line 5375 of the included jquery, *event.returnValue is deprecated*

2013-12-08 23:10:17	jrobeson	yeah that's why i'm keeping it too

2013-12-08 23:11:09	jrobeson	reminds me that i've never looked at how jquery 2.0 and zepto compare size wise now

2013-12-11 09:43:21	rvanlieshout	:)
2013-12-11 09:43:37	toretore	Lann: {} is a hash. a hash contains key => value pairs. to get the value associated with a key you can use hash[key]; you can have hashes as values; then hash[key] returns a hash. you can use hash[key] on that hash.

2013-12-11 09:53:05	pipecloud	Ruby provides enough for daemons without a library. But there's also some gems that add a lot of niceties.
2013-12-11 09:53:25	Lann	it seems there are more than one, is there one that's more suited to rails itself with access to activerecord?
2013-12-11 09:53:37	pipecloud	I would suggest learning as much with just ruby core and stdlib as possible to become a better developer with ruby.
2013-12-11 09:53:50	rvanlieshout	Lann: a gem that makes your app a daemon shouldn't care what you do in it
2013-12-11 09:53:54	rvanlieshout	or what you access
2013-12-11 09:53:57	rvanlieshout	https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/daemonizing
2013-12-11 09:54:17	Lann	i dont want to daemonize the app, but rather a piece of the app if that makes sense

2013-12-12 17:28:26	Sylario	Fidelix: you have to create the foreign id in migrations
2013-12-12 17:28:34	Fire-Dragon-DoL	tubbo: so you mean what is in mygem/app/helpers/myengine/myhelper_helper.rb gets auto imported by the engine into my rails app?

2013-12-12 17:39:12	tubbo	Fidelix: the guides are for people who are 100% new to rails.
2013-12-12 17:39:12	AntelopeSalad	Fidelix: i used the guide combined with a free pass to codeschool to learn rails from ground 0
2013-12-12 17:39:35	tubbo	Fidelix: people who are experienced usually just go to api.rubyonrails.org...they already understand the concepts, it's just syntax they need a refresher on.
2013-12-12 17:39:51	tubbo	Fidelix: also, many people who use rails came from MVC backgrounds...so it's really just "learning how the magic works".

2013-12-18 15:51:24	Cork	i'm trying to do something like this ModuleA.join(:module_b).where("module_bs.done = ?", true).group("module_as.id").count
2013-12-18 15:51:58	Cork	but i get a big hash instead of the id's from ModuleA where B matnched
2013-12-18 15:52:09	Cork	how do one express this with active record?
2013-12-18 15:52:09	universa1	Cork: why fake code?
2013-12-18 15:52:18	Cork	cause i don't have the other code yet
2013-12-18 15:52:31	universa1	Cork: your models are ModuleA and ModuleB ?

2013-12-18 15:53:41	Cork	and i'm not sure how to express that to get the same result

2013-12-18 15:56:43	ddd	hash returned is every module with done = true correct? and you want to include all those into ModuleA. So, either run that and get the hash of all of them and then use an .each on the returned hash members to .join() into ModuleA, or wrap taht *entire* search with ().each do and .join() in the block each member
2013-12-18 15:56:50	ddd	only things I can think of from what you're showing
2013-12-18 15:56:52	mikepence	hey guys, what is the syntax for the version in your gemfile to use 4.1 beta 1?

2013-12-18 16:38:09	spamotuve	ok

2013-12-22 14:30:52	zeromodulus	'rails console'
2013-12-22 14:30:59	dagen	just a moment
2013-12-22 14:31:24	zeromodulus	try opening up the 'rails console' and executing the code in the index action, and then you can see what results you're getting.

2013-12-22 14:34:30	dagen	do you mean tail -f log/development.log?
2013-12-22 14:34:41	zeromodulus	if you type in 'rails console' in your terminal, you'll have an irb session with your app loaded.
2013-12-22 14:35:12	zeromodulus	then you can execute the code you're having problems with one line at a time.
2013-12-22 14:35:20	zeromodulus	and then print the results.
2013-12-22 14:35:27	dagen	there is an output from console: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2c028970e6c5fd8424cf
2013-12-22 14:35:57	dagen	i use unicorn web server
2013-12-22 14:36:06	zeromodulus	are you on Linux or Windows or...?
2013-12-22 14:36:22	dagen	Ubuntu Linux ofcourse
2013-12-22 14:36:49	zeromodulus	okay, so, in your project directory, on the terminal, type in 'rails console' and press enter.
2013-12-22 14:37:23	dagen	jam
2013-12-22 14:37:29	dagen	done
2013-12-22 14:37:52	zeromodulus	okay, so now you can type in ruby code, and you can access your models too.
2013-12-22 14:38:10	-->	vlad_starkov has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-22 14:38:19	zeromodulus	so you can execute something like 'Customer.all'

2013-12-22 14:39:28	dagen	great! thanks for this advice!
2013-12-22 14:39:48	zeromodulus	so now you can figure out what the correct query should be to get the results you're looking for.
2013-12-22 14:40:03	zeromodulus	and you can keep experimenting until you have the correct query, then you can just drop it in your index action.
2013-12-22 14:40:56	zeromodulus	does that make sense?

2013-12-22 15:43:56	zeromodulus	dagen: you can also use the rails console like I mentioned earlier to try and create a record by hand.
2013-12-22 15:44:12	zeromodulus	dagen: and then you can do something like 'customer.errors' and it will show you exactly why the record is failing to be created.
2013-12-22 15:44:20	<--	mojjojo has quit (Client Quit)
2013-12-22 15:45:04	zeromodulus	dagen: Perhaps when you create the records, the passport creation fails, but unless you output the errors, you won't know why.
2013-12-22 15:45:59	zeromodulus	dagen: so if you try to create a record by hand, create a user and a passport and just build the entire record on the console by hand... you can then call passport.errors or customer.errors and it will tell you why it's failing.
2013-12-22 15:47:19	zeromodulus	dagen: for example, customer = Customer.create({:name => "whatever"}); puts customer.errors
2013-12-22 15:47:37	dagen	zeromodulus this is great idea
2013-12-22 15:48:00	zeromodulus	dagen: you can do that in your db/seeds.rb file too.

2013-12-27 17:12:03	madnificent	tfitts: DRY when possible.  i'd argue that if you need to generate the content for your page from the rails end anyway, it's sane to build a partial and send that in as a result.  where i needed to change more than block of html content, I've thrown the result of the generated partials in a json document more than once.

2013-12-27 20:36:04	bricker`work	tubbo: They way I learned it was that capybara was Functional tests - testing a feature. When the user clicks the "Logout" button, then he ends up on the login page with a "logged out" message. "Integration" tests would test that clicking the Logout button called the "logout" action and then performed a redirect and rendered the "logout" message.

2013-12-27 20:45:47	tubbo	bricker`work: well my argument to that first assertion would be "why do we have to simulate clicking the button?"
2013-12-27 20:46:03	tubbo	bricker`work: just make the request to the controller behind the scenes. now it's *only* testing the request-response cycle.
2013-12-27 20:46:41	tubbo	bricker`work: given that i've never heard the term "functional test" outside of the rails paradigm, i would also argue that it's a made-up term and doesn't actually mean anything.
2013-12-27 20:46:52	bricker`work	tubbo: yeah, that's fine, but you're not testing the whole feature. You're testing a part of it.
2013-12-27 20:47:03	bricker`work	tubbo: are you being serious? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing
2013-12-27 20:47:36	tubbo	bricker`work: yes, i typically hear of "unit" OR "integration" tests. but it seems as though people are munging "integration" with "functional" ;)
2013-12-27 20:47:47	tubbo	bricker`work: "Functional Testing usually describes what the system does."
2013-12-27 20:47:59	tubbo	bricker`work: but rails controller tests are *not* functional tests as defined by that wiki article.
2013-12-27 20:48:10	bricker`work	tubbo: that's right, they're not.

2013-12-27 20:49:13	bricker`work	tubbo: controller tests are controller tests. It's weird. They are integration tests - You're testing the request/response lifecycle - except we treat them as unit tests, because we're not really testing all the Rack backend and ActionDispatch code

2013-12-27 20:50:22	bricker`work	tubbo: that's right. And that's a fine way to test your controllers. But you should still have some system in place to test that the user can still create a Post or whatever
2013-12-27 20:50:29	tubbo	oh sure
2013-12-27 20:50:39	bricker`work	tubbo: you're right, it is.
2013-12-27 20:50:51	tubbo	bricker`work: my integration tests are really there to make sure everything is in the right place, visually.
2013-12-27 20:51:12	tubbo	by the time i'm writing functional tests and shit...i have enough unit tests to describe the functional as a "sum of all parts" type thing

2013-12-27 20:51:48	tubbo	the functional tests are essentially testing the "gateway" to that logic, and the integration tests ensure the whole thing works properly, as well as ensures that buttons appear in the right places, etc.

2013-12-27 20:55:21	tubbo	i at least can get it to a staging server without having to run `rails s` locally most of the time. i only boot the server when i want to design the CSS or something.
2013-12-27 20:56:06	tubbo	but in the case of this current app, there's really no sense in me running `rails server`. it's just a JSON API, so i don't need to design CSS or even ensure that all my files are being loaded by the browser properly. a browser will probably never hit this API.

2013-12-27 21:46:22	terrellt	You ran shelter.update_attributes(name: nil), that doesn't bypass validations
2013-12-27 21:46:27	terrellt	So that's returning false without you checking.
2013-12-27 21:46:31	terrellt	You never modify the record.
2013-12-27 21:46:35	terrellt	So the one in the database is still valid.
2013-12-27 21:46:48	terrellt	https://gist.github.com/ddd/8152270#file-shelters_controller_spec-rb-L64 # => false
2013-12-27 21:47:02	ddd	biut I have if @shelter.valid? == true && @shelter.update_attributes(params[:shelter])
2013-12-27 21:47:22	ddd	that means it should fail. neither one are true
2013-12-27 21:47:51	terrellt	All you're patching is the ID, no?
2013-12-27 21:48:13	ddd	righjt, so because it fails, it should set flash[:error] but its not
2013-12-27 21:48:19	terrellt	This is like if you submitted a form with just the ID attribute.
2013-12-27 21:48:25	ddd	no not even touching the id. i'm touching a validated field
2013-12-27 21:48:33	ddd	name not id
2013-12-27 21:48:40	rushed	ddd: or are you :)
2013-12-27 21:48:42	ddd	name is validates presence: true
2013-12-27 21:48:44	terrellt	Your name never gets reset. Let me go through the flow of events for you.
2013-12-27 21:49:31	ddd	i pull from the db (valid), i call update_attributes(name: nil) which should now make the record invalid when i try to save it., and it does as you can see from @messages (name can't be blank)
2013-12-27 21:50:01	terrellt	ddd: shelter, your test's local variable, and the shelter your controller is using are two different things.
2013-12-27 21:50:02	ddd	so it should fail the if @shelter.valid? == true && @shelter.update_attributes(params[:shelter]) which should in turn set flash[:errors] and flash.now
2013-12-27 21:50:09	ddd	but as you can see it doesn
2013-12-27 21:50:09	ddd	t
2013-12-27 21:50:37	ddd	terrellt: even if its just using the local shelter var only, it should STILL fail
2013-12-27 21:50:48	ddd	the shelter is invalid and thats the var i'm using in the test
2013-12-27 21:51:17	ddd	i'm purposefully setting invalid information to ensur that it does in fact fail both validations and to be saved

2013-12-27 21:52:09	terrellt	It shouldn't fail. Shelter, the local variable, is invalid. Updated_at didn't change because when you tried to persist to the database -it failed-
2013-12-27 21:52:10	ddd	the problem here is that the flashes never get set. It IS in fact invalid (as the expect(shelter).to be_invalid passes)
2013-12-27 21:52:12	terrellt	One second.
2013-12-27 21:52:25	terrellt	Let me fix this test so you see what should be going on

2013-12-27 21:53:12	ddd	right because updated_at didn't change then the check updated_at_changed? test should also be false
2013-12-27 21:53:22	bricker`work	ddd: two things:
2013-12-27 21:53:34	ddd	which is right. it didn't get saved so the updated_at timestamp did not change
2013-12-27 21:53:37	bricker`work	ddd: 1. In your tests, always use bang methods for save, update, etc.
2013-12-27 21:53:47	ddd	thought i did.
2013-12-27 21:53:50	-->	Choclo has joined #RubyOnRails
2013-12-27 21:53:54	bricker`work	ddd: 2. this: `shelter.update_attributes(name: nil)` doesn't do anything. So when your controller gets called, it's pulling an re-saving a valid record.
2013-12-27 21:54:00	ddd	oh you mean on the update_attributes
2013-12-27 21:54:13	ddd	err? yes it does do something
2013-12-27 21:54:20	ddd	guys guys, look at the rspec output.
2013-12-27 21:54:33	ddd	it IS doing something. the shelter is failing validations *as it should*

2013-12-27 21:55:16	bricker`work	ddd: er, what's the problem then?
2013-12-27 21:55:22	ddd	*because* it failed the validation, the flash.now and flash[:errors] should be set
2013-12-27 21:55:24	ddd	they're not
2013-12-27 21:55:29	terrellt	ddd: https://gist.github.com/terrellt/8152480 You want something like that.
2013-12-27 21:55:57	ddd	so while its properly being invalidated, the error messages are not being set in the flash and i don't know why
2013-12-27 21:56:02	ddd	so checks on the flash are failing
2013-12-27 21:57:19	terrellt	ddd: You're not understanding that the object the controller acts upon and the "shelter" object are two different things. Flash is set as successful because you were putting a valid request in - ITS shelter object was totally valid and updateable.
2013-12-27 21:57:31	terrellt	ddd: YOURS is not, so its messages got set.
2013-12-27 21:57:47	ddd	doing the check on expect(shelter.updated_at_changed?).to be_false works. so all my tests pass. but if you p shelter.inspect and p flashes.inspect the flashes aren't being set even though 'update' in the controller specifically sets them

2013-12-27 21:59:31	ddd	and I am passing the specific shelter object from my test to the controller.  patch :update, id: shelter.to_param
2013-12-27 21:59:38	ddd	so i'm passing the test's shelter object
2013-12-27 21:59:57	rushed	ddd: the shelter variable in your test is not the same as @shelter in your controller, also you're using the word "should" a lot and asserting things when you might be better off with some additional logging or throwing a binding.pry in the controller so you can poke at the objects and recheck your mental model of what is happening

2013-12-27 22:00:34	ddd	right. that object was previously saved. before i modified the object.
2013-12-27 22:00:41	ddd	see the shelter.save! line?

2013-12-27 22:03:23	terrellt	When do you patch :update, :id => shelter.param it's the patch equivalent of http://your-site/shelter/1, NO ARGUMENTS. You're not requesting -any data- be changed. You think you're telling it to use the shelter object you passed, with the name you set in your local variable, but you're not. You're just telling it "look up this ID in the database on your own", and what's in the database -does not match- what your object is.

2013-12-27 22:06:39	ddd	that is *exactly* what i thought i was telling it. by using to_param I thought I was converting it to a params hash and passing the shelter object the test was working on *along with its data* to the controller to populate the SheltersController's @shelter var.

2013-12-28 15:20:08	Delacram	 Still reading/trying to get a feel for what you're trying to do
2013-12-28 15:20:21	Delacram	Never dealt with Twitter's API before
2013-12-28 15:20:32	sakshi	ok
2013-12-28 15:22:42	Delacram	This isn't really  Rails question :p , But I think a good starting point for you would be to get the array of retweeters of the particular tweet, and then use ActiveRecord to sort
2013-12-28 15:23:15	Delacram	Do you know the method used in sferik/twitter to find retweeter handles?
2013-12-28 15:23:27	sakshi	No
2013-12-28 15:24:14	Delacram	I don't either. And it doesn't appear to have such a method
2013-12-28 15:24:37	Delacram	Have you gone to the twitter api to see if the handles of people who have retweeeted a tweet are even available?
2013-12-28 15:25:08	Delacram	You may want to use a gem like Nokogiri to crawl the page that displays all the people who retweeted a particular tweet

2014-01-15 11:56:13	rvanlieshout	in that case just create a hash and use locals: your_hash

2014-01-15 12:15:26	mfoo	Hello. I have a rails engine mounted. My engine's ApplicationController inherits from the parent ApplicationController. When config.cache_classes is false in the parent a page from the engine works fine until the page is refreshed and then it fails. This seems to be because the parent code is unloaded before the second request and is not loaded back again.

2014-01-15 12:39:26	mfoo	rushed, I fixed the issue bizarrely. Can somebody explain how the two lines in http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html#using-a-controller-provided-by-the-application is different to http://pastebin.com/37xePag7 ? The rails guide code works properly and loads the parent application class as expected, while the engine in the paste shows an undefined constant ParentApplicationName after a refresh with config.cache_classes=false.
2014-01-15 12:39:27	helpa	Hi mfoo. We in #rubyonrails would really appreciate it if you did not use pastebin during your time with us.
2014-01-15 12:39:27	helpa	Pastebin is not good because it loads slowly for most, has ads which are distracting and has terrible formatting. Please use Gist (http://gist.github.com) or Pastie (http://pastie.org) instead. Thanks!
