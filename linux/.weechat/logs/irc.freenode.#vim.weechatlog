2013-12-05 08:37:37	gravitation	I ask you to look very closely at "map <silent> se :e!<CR>"
2013-12-05 08:38:19	gravitation	should it be any different than pressing ":e!" manually? because for me it is.
2013-12-05 08:38:20	gravitation	using the map version there by pressing "se" does indeed reload my buffer, but then it also pauses for a moment... and inserts a single space at where the cursor currently is
2013-12-05 08:38:24	gravitation	it's very weird
2013-12-05 08:38:27	gravitation	and I need to fix it

2013-12-05 08:41:23	gravitation	I actually just delete the <silent> to see if it fixed
2013-12-05 08:41:25	gravitation	and it did
2013-12-05 08:42:11	gravitation	and then I put the <silent> back, to see if it would break again
2013-12-05 08:42:11	gravitation	but it didn't O.o
2013-12-05 08:42:11	gravitation	so problem solved I guess :-p
2013-12-05 08:42:11	gravitation	but I'll remember that trick for next time, cool
2013-12-05 08:42:33	phy1729	for the whole process

2013-12-05 08:44:28	gravitation	if it doesn't see the opening $$ and closing $$ pairs on the screen at once it gets confused, and does the highlighting all wrong

2013-12-05 08:44:47	gravitation	basically I'd like it to always scan the whole file to do the hilighting, or at least just a bit more of it
2013-12-05 08:44:48	gravitation	is there anyway to do that?
2013-12-05 08:45:11	dolio	Yes.

2013-12-05 08:46:55	gravitation	I think I need "syntax sync minlines=1000," or something to that effect
2013-12-05 08:47:00	gravitation	that'd be a lot more reasonable
2013-12-05 08:47:35	gravitation	wait, it still might get stupid then though, if the space between 1000 lines back and 10001 lines back is on a boundary between opening and closing $$ pairs then it might still break
2013-12-05 08:47:42	gravitation	I think I have to have it scan the whole file actually, ugh
2013-12-05 08:47:48	gravitation	I hope that won't be too slow

2013-12-05 08:49:30	gravitation	I think parsing plain tex for highlighting is probably complicated by the fact that $a+b$ is an in-line math item, while $$a+b$$ is a page-centered math item
2013-12-05 08:49:32	<--	captbaritone has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2013-12-05 08:50:34	gravitation	so $$ can be mistakenly parsed as an empty in-line item when its really the opening or closing of a page-centered display item

2013-12-05 08:58:15	hansz	Another onw that doesn't work: when I `:imap \\`, I get `i  \\          *@<C-G>u\\<CR>`, but typing `\\` in insert mode does nothing.

2013-12-05 10:10:07	gravitation	I noticed when when there's a literal \t in a buffer VIM likes to represent the tab as X number of spaces, and it forces you to put the cursor at the END of that set of spaces
2013-12-05 10:10:13	gravitation	I'd rather it be at the beginning
2013-12-05 10:10:33	gravitation	so that if a line consists of just the \t character, I can have the cursor be at the "beginning" of the line instead of at the "end"

2013-12-05 10:29:28	gravitation	Harzilein: I mostly write TeX and C, C++, and Obj-C code. Those mappings make it easier to type common symbols in those languages. The most common ones are on the fingers closest to the home row (that's the logic)
2013-12-05 10:30:00	gravitation	so for example in TeX you're always typing the \ character, which is a bit of a stretch of the hand. I find it a lot more comfortable to type ctrl-k_l, which requires no movement off the home row

2013-12-05 10:32:04	gravitation	likewise in C, C++, and Obj-C the = character is extremely common, and likewise requires moving off of the home row

2013-12-05 15:01:26	Industrial	Is there a way for vim to 'inteligently' decide that strings that are versioned software names are whole words? like `foo-1.24.12-a.js`
2013-12-05 15:01:26	FireFly	syn-match (:syntax match) is probably the most straightforward one, together with syn-keyword
2013-12-05 15:01:43	<--	thelorax123 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-05 15:01:55	FireFly	syn-match is just a regex pattern to match against, syn-keyword is a set of keywords (with chars in 'isk') to match against
2013-12-05 15:01:55	Industrial	I almost never want to skip 5 words inside that phrase, but almost always just want to skip or select over it.
2013-12-05 15:02:18	-->	seoNinjaWarrior has joined #vim
2013-12-05 15:02:32	FireFly	syn-region is a bit more interesting: it has a start and end pattern, so it's for things like parens and string literals
2013-12-05 15:02:32	jad_	Industrial: do you already know about the difference between word and WORD?

2013-12-06 09:11:28	baumy	people in here seem overly concerned about not wanting to change vanilla vim much, in case they have to use vim on a box that isn't theirs, which ive never understood unless all of you are sysadmins for massive places
2013-12-06 09:11:39	baumy	switching keyboard layouts entirely seems like that same problem dialed up to the max
2013-12-06 09:11:57	sashah	I have a huge config, and no problem using vim without a config

2013-12-06 09:13:39	paradigm	mostly warning newbies off overwriting defaults they don't understand and shooting themselves in the foot in the long term
2013-12-06 09:13:45	baumy	its something i here said on here and r/vim a lot =/
2013-12-06 09:13:45	-->	nostoq has joined #vim
2013-12-06 09:13:51	paradigm	if you understand what you're changing and the repercussions everyone in here seems cool with it
2013-12-06 09:13:54	sashah	that's true, I feel like I've seen that argument almost everywhere else (like r/vim)
2013-12-06 09:14:02	paradigm	r/vim is another matter >.>
2013-12-06 09:14:08	nostoq	(test)
2013-12-06 09:14:08	baumy	half the people on r/vim are regulars on here
2013-12-06 09:14:15	baumy	well maybe not half
2013-12-06 09:14:19	baumy	but some of the more vocal ones
2013-12-06 09:14:31	_Cody	paradigm: what means rvim?
2013-12-06 09:14:35	_Cody	nv heard
2013-12-06 09:14:45	sashah	_Cody: as in reddit.com/r/vim
2013-12-06 09:14:47	paradigm	_Cody: reddit.com/r/vim
2013-12-06 09:14:50	baumy	anyway thats just my impression from idling in here for about a year now, i could easily just have a biased recollection
2013-12-06 09:14:51	_Cody	ok
2013-12-06 09:15:02	baumy	i tend to notice that since my vim is....heavily configured

2013-12-06 09:15:14	-->	tmallen has joined #vim
2013-12-06 09:15:17	paradigm	my vim is also pretty heavily configured, never heard any complaints in here
2013-12-06 09:15:23	baumy	so of course its my instinct to jump in and defend that, since what if somebody thinks im wrong on the internet?
2013-12-06 09:15:25	tmallen	new plugin :) https://github.com/oinksoft/skel.vim
2013-12-06 09:15:25	paradigm	maybe about some of the specific choices I made, but not the general thing
2013-12-06 09:15:37	sashah	baumy: I have a crazy vim also, it's possible you are right but I just haven't noticed
2013-12-06 09:15:39	tmallen	the docs are only in the .vim file so i haven't published it to vim.org yet
2013-12-06 09:15:44	tmallen	but check it out :)
2013-12-06 09:15:58	tmallen	i actually created this project with skel.vim
2013-12-06 09:16:07	tmallen	starting out with just a vim file that i sourced
2013-12-06 09:16:15	baumy	im not quite sure what you mean by scaffold
2013-12-06 09:16:16	<--	Cakey has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2013-12-06 09:16:30	tmallen	oh, like make a bunch of folders and files
2013-12-06 09:16:36	tmallen	and replace template stuff
2013-12-06 09:16:45	tmallen	(in file paths and in the contents)
2013-12-06 09:17:30	sashah	tmallen: congrats on your new project. :) I will poke at it tomorrow if I remember.
2013-12-06 09:17:30	tmallen	could be a command line tool but sometimes i want sometihng like this to make little stuff when in vim
2013-12-06 09:17:39	tmallen	my only popular projects are vimscripts lol
2013-12-06 09:17:53	sashah	I never settled on a tool for this, I have a few use cases like making python packages
2013-12-06 09:18:09	sashah	and some bad code I use privately
2013-12-06 09:18:26	tmallen	ya
2013-12-06 09:18:34	tmallen	i actually wanted it for making .. vim plugins Xp
2013-12-06 09:18:47	sashah	baumy: if it's any comfort I think that argument that you have to stick to vanilla vim is pretty silly and always did
2013-12-06 09:18:48	tmallen	i got tired of always copying my makefiels etc
2013-12-06 09:19:05	tmallen	i'm going ot use it for python packages at work tomorrow
2013-12-06 09:19:22	tmallen	because i've been refactoring this project to a standard structure
2013-12-06 09:19:31	sashah	tmallen: there's a decent python commandline tool called mrbob for scaffolding
2013-12-06 09:19:35	sashah	but I'm too lazy to use it properly
2013-12-06 09:19:54	tmallen	eh that looks complicated
2013-12-06 09:20:21	tmallen	this just basically does a cp -R, replacing {foo} with k=v params and __foo in pathnames
2013-12-06 09:21:09	<--	bambanx has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2013-12-06 09:21:19	tmallen	it can ignore path patterns and also just copy binaries (not treat them as templates)

2013-12-06 11:24:13	dhruvasagar	d3x: you can press a count and then press ':' and then your command, the initial count is then used to construct the range, I am just finding this out, sounds pretty neat

Looking at the code, it seems that it doesn't have seperate binds for <leader><leader>w etc, but rather add a motion after the mapping of easymotion (<leader><leader>). I'm not any good in vimscript so I might be wrong though.

2013-12-06 17:21:36	bakers	In a nutshell what's the diff between nmap and noremap
2013-12-06 17:22:14	mattboehm	nmap is recursive,
2013-12-06 17:22:24	mattboehm	so the right side gets checked for mappings
2013-12-06 17:22:26	mattboehm	example
2013-12-06 17:22:30	timss	bakers: this is a good explaination: http://stackoverflow.com/a/3776182/1076493
2013-12-06 17:22:30	mattboehm	imap a b
2013-12-06 17:22:34	mattboehm	imap b c
2013-12-06 17:22:53	mattboehm	a is mapped to b but then it notices that b is mapped to c
2013-12-06 17:22:57	-->	taotetek has joined #vim
2013-12-06 17:22:59	mattboehm	so your result is c
2013-12-06 17:23:00	bakers	Ahhhhhhh
2013-12-06 17:23:04	-->	starkhalo has joined #vim
2013-12-06 17:23:27	bakers	So it's... no recursive map?

2013-12-06 17:23:33	bakers	no... what's the o in there for?
2013-12-06 17:23:34	mattboehm	usually you want nnoremap. the one exception is when you know the right side is a mapping

2013-12-06 17:44:27	timss	Maybe, but it's usually not a good idea to map anything to ctrl/alt/super because it relies on the terminal/environment used. That is, if Vim even interpretes super (windows key).
2013-12-06 17:44:55	timss	Maybe Gvim will accept it, maybe not. My impression is that you shouldn't really bother.

2013-12-28 17:03:31	LeoNerd	vim's internals are somewhat broken in that it conflates Esc-letter with Unicode characters :/
2013-12-28 17:04:00	LeoNerd	It's basically impossible to use the full set of either together. Decide which you'd rather have - Unicode, or Esc-[printing] keypresses
2013-12-28 17:06:18	osse	grirgz: how about glob(g:SCveco_project_root . '/*')

2013-12-28 17:06:50	LeoNerd	That won't help either
2013-12-28 17:07:01	LeoNerd	meta8:false will at least let /other programs/ which are not vim, tell the difference
2013-12-28 17:07:06	LeoNerd	vim alone is -doubly- broken in this regard
2013-12-28 17:07:39	<--	mitz has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-28 17:07:44	LeoNerd	Leave it turned off, so that Esc-prefixing happens. That will let readline/irssi/etc.. other things, all cope fine
2013-12-28 17:08:04	LeoNerd	vim is broken in internals, and there's no way to fix that by just sending different things from the terminal.
2013-12-28 17:08:46	cyx^	well. I guess I'll hack it with URxvt.keysym.Meta-m: í --and-- map í <C-W>j

2013-12-28 17:12:10	LeoNerd	You could give up, or you could post to the vim developer's list saying "hey, I want to be able to do this".. and see what happens
2013-12-28 17:12:30	LeoNerd	I've been arguing for years that it's broken but Bram never listens.. so it'd be nice to have more voices from real users say "hey I want this to work"
2013-12-28 17:12:53	FernandoBasso	Nothing will happen, probably. Some days ago someone showed us that several patches were simply refused.

2013-12-28 17:15:36	FernandoBasso	Perhaps your idea is better, just start a new project that gets vi/vim good ideas leaving behind vim mistakes.
2013-12-28 17:15:43	grirgz	osse: this don't complete anything anymore, is there a way to debug this, like print the result ? i've tryed also return glob(g:SCveco_project_root . '/' . a:A . '*') cause i think it need the current text to complete (the function header is fun! ListProjects(A,L,P) and the command declaration is command! -nargs=1 -complete=customlist,ListProjects VecoOpenProject :call SCveco_open_project(<f-args>)   )
2013-12-28 17:16:36	FernandoBasso	Also, there must be vim aspects that were nice more than 15 yearas ago, and which are outdated nowadays.

2013-12-28 17:17:51	thevishy	is there any advantage of having swap files ?  I am planning to set if off
2013-12-28 17:17:53	-->	ynot has joined #vim
2013-12-28 17:18:06	osse	thevishy: if vim crashes
2013-12-28 17:18:18	FernandoBasso	thevishy: Better a version controll system, but it won't hurt to have swap files.
2013-12-28 17:18:18	osse	or if you don't exit it properly
2013-12-28 17:18:30	FernandoBasso	I have them in a special dir...
2013-12-28 17:18:45	FernandoBasso	So they are not scattered across my system.

2013-12-28 17:19:00	thevishy	ok that sounds neat
2013-12-28 17:19:08	thevishy	so you have it on osse ?
2013-12-28 17:19:16	osse	thevishy: yes, I use the defaults
2013-12-28 17:19:24	FireFly	There's not much reason to turn it off I think
2013-12-28 17:19:40	thevishy	right if it can be into a single directory then perhaps I will do that

2013-12-28 17:20:06	thevishy	is it the backup dir  ?
2013-12-28 17:20:14	osse	the only reason for them to be scattered is if they are actually needed
2013-12-28 17:20:33	thevishy	right
2013-12-28 17:20:39	FernandoBasso	Oh, of course I was confusing swap files with backup files...

2013-12-28 17:20:54	FernandoBasso	For which I have these settings: set backup, set backupdir=~/Vim_Stuff/backup, set backupext=.vimbkp
2013-12-28 17:21:07	thevishy	right
2013-12-28 17:21:31	thevishy	so swap is something I need think whether I need it . if vim crashes what happens usually
2013-12-28 17:21:34	-->	master_j has joined #vim
2013-12-28 17:21:51	thevishy	i would think the file to be at last saved position

2013-12-28 22:56:19	vimgor	There is nothing wrong with Vim distributions (spf13, cream, janus, etc.) per se, but when a distribution tries to simplify everything, you could encounter problems (broken plugins, weird mappings) that wouldn't occur with vanilla Vim. People in #vim generally don't like helping other people demystifing them. Also: http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1mygwg/vim_from_n00b_to_meh/ccdw5h8

2013-12-28 22:57:10	FernandoBasso	I think that vimgor fact should be changed...
2013-12-28 22:57:13	fmost	i wanted to switch the solarized background from dark to light, and i changed the corresponding line in vimrc, but the outcome is that only the current line is white (full white, not cream), and everything else is black. the same setup works well in gvim
2013-12-28 22:57:29	fmost	so i was wondering if there is any easy fix
2013-12-28 22:57:37	fmost	or if i should start disabling plugins one by one
2013-12-28 22:57:50	-->	alps has joined #vim
2013-12-28 22:58:03	fmost	also it seems i am missing the ToggleBG function referenced in the solarized doc
2013-12-28 22:58:24	fmost	but i should have the full solarized package since i have the doc <_<
2013-12-28 22:58:53	lhynes	fmost: is solarized available to your terminal? like, it's own colorscheme?
2013-12-28 22:59:21	fmost	i'll try that now
2013-12-28 22:59:42	fmost	i tought that was guaranteed since i have color solarized in vimrc
2013-12-28 22:59:52	fmost	but i never tried setting it manually from a running vim

2013-12-28 23:00:23	lhynes	fmost: my thinking, and it's only that, is that you'll need a solarized scheme for your terminal in order for the changes you want to take effect
2013-12-28 23:00:27	fmost	it seems so, at least :colorscheme solarized does not complain
2013-12-28 23:01:17	fmost	i'm googling how to list all available colorscheme
2013-12-28 23:01:29	chimeracoder	fmost: I don't know about listing them all
2013-12-28 23:01:29	fmost	and by googling i mean also looking at the doc
2013-12-28 23:01:33	chimeracoder	but for me they tabcomplete
2013-12-28 23:01:42	<--	FernandoBasso has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
2013-12-28 23:01:45	chimeracoder	if you want to check that one exists
2013-12-28 23:02:15	fmost	well, apparently :colo returns the current schema, and it says solarized

2013-12-28 23:18:52	fmost	ok, it seems it is a palette problem, solarized should set the default 16 color palette to something reasonable but it is not working, so the maintainers of spf13 added the line let g:solarized_termcolors=256 in the vimrc file
2013-12-28 23:19:07	fmost	removing it breaks everything, since my terminal is indeed in 256 colors
2013-12-28 23:19:16	fmost	i'm thinking of a way to fix this

2013-12-29 10:06:35	JosephFerano	one thing I do want to get working
2013-12-29 10:06:45	JosephFerano	it was a feature that I always missed from Monodevelop
2013-12-29 10:06:48	JosephFerano	it has a "Surround With"
2013-12-29 10:07:01	JosephFerano	and you could surround any block of code with an if, while, or whatever
2013-12-29 10:07:03	Watabou	As for NERDTree, it's fine if you want it but I found it a bit useless because I was fine with vim's default :Sex command :)
2013-12-29 10:07:12	<--	Synthead has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-29 10:07:17	JosephFerano	so that's actually a thing
2013-12-29 10:07:23	JosephFerano	lol
2013-12-29 10:07:34	JosephFerano	I put :sex in the googol research and that wasn't quite what I was looking for
2013-12-29 10:07:51	JosephFerano	oh that thing
2013-12-29 10:07:55	Watabou	No I don't think that will work haha
2013-12-29 10:08:02	JosephFerano	I've seen it, I was wondering if there was a way of getting it on command
2013-12-29 10:08:14	Watabou	:Sex is just vim's native file explorer but it opens in a split which is nice
2013-12-29 10:08:14	-->	nstdloop has joined #vim
2013-12-29 10:08:14	JosephFerano	right, but you can only see 1 folder at a time no?
2013-12-29 10:08:34	Watabou	Yeah, but if you wanted to find files, you can just use ctrlp
2013-12-29 10:09:36	Watabou	As for surrounding, I don't know if there's a surround plugin to work with if, while or for loops, but there's a surround plugin which surrounds text with parens, quotes, braces, etc
2013-12-29 10:09:49	Watabou	It's actually in my list of top 5 essential plugins
2013-12-29 10:09:57	JosephFerano	yeah, I got that one too
2013-12-29 10:10:09	Watabou	Ah okay then
2013-12-29 10:10:26	JosephFerano	I saw somewhere where tim pope said you could get custom surrounds working actually
2013-12-29 10:10:34	JosephFerano	cause there's one that works with <tags>
2013-12-29 10:10:59	Watabou	Well it's actually pretty easy to surround code with that plugin
2013-12-29 10:11:25	JosephFerano	yeah, I was going to look into that too
2013-12-29 10:11:28	Watabou	SO if you visually select a line, you can then do  S{iif   to surround it with an if
2013-12-29 10:11:38	JosephFerano	oh?
2013-12-29 10:11:45	JosephFerano	didn't work last time I tried it
2013-12-29 10:11:50	JosephFerano	oh, I think I get it
2013-12-29 10:12:22	JosephFerano	oh man, I didn't know you could that, awesome

2013-12-29 10:12:49	JosephFerano	man, OmniSharp is kinda slow
2013-12-29 10:13:01	JosephFerano	I'm not sure if it's OmniSharp or NeoComplCache that's slow
2013-12-29 10:13:12	Watabou	Yeah actually most omniplugins are pretty slow.
2013-12-29 10:13:26	JosephFerano	oh yeah, it's definitely the omniplugin
2013-12-29 10:13:33	JosephFerano	omnisharp
2013-12-29 10:13:38	Watabou	Neocomplcache is definitely slow. NeoComplete is much faster though.
2013-12-29 10:14:06	JosephFerano	man, I wish I could use it, it was just giving me so much trouble
2013-12-29 10:14:54	JosephFerano	I don't know, do you think you could help me out with it?
2013-12-29 10:14:58	Watabou	I think it's still in beta but he's pushing out updates pretty much daily. Think it will be ready soon to replace neocomplcache
2013-12-29 10:15:18	JosephFerano	well, the thing is I just don't know how to integrate it with OmniSharp, I think that was the problem I was having
2013-12-29 10:15:23	JosephFerano	it wasn't integrating properly
2013-12-29 10:15:30	Watabou	Yeah I'm not sure if that works either
2013-12-29 10:15:57	Watabou	Neocomplete definitely doesn't work with a C autocomplete plugin I use either and I'm not sure how to get around that part

2013-12-29 10:16:18	JosephFerano	never mind then
2013-12-29 10:16:28	JosephFerano	I guess I'll check it out in a few months, see if it improves
2013-12-29 10:17:10	Watabou	Yeah definitely. I think it's come pretty far since I began to use it.
2013-12-29 10:17:25	Watabou	Or maybe you could try Youcompleteme to see how that works for you
2013-12-29 10:17:35	JosephFerano	does that use it's own completion system
2013-12-29 10:17:37	JosephFerano	?
2013-12-29 10:18:04	JosephFerano	only thing that would suck is not being able to use snippets with neocomplcache
2013-12-29 10:18:14	JosephFerano	oh nevermind
2013-12-29 10:18:25	JosephFerano	it has UtilSnips completion
2013-12-29 10:18:54	Watabou	Yeah you can get snippets with ultisnips.
2013-12-29 10:19:43	JosephFerano	it would be even more awesome if I could get snippets working with Macros :D
2013-12-29 10:19:49	Watabou	It's actually a great plugin, but you have to actually compile it. You can't just put it in Vundle
2013-12-29 10:20:00	JosephFerano	YouCompleteMe?

2013-12-29 10:21:12	JosephFerano	wow dude, the read me for this thing is intense
2013-12-29 10:21:52	Watabou	Yeah it's why I avoided it in the first place haha
2013-12-29 10:22:00	Watabou	It also has support for OmniSharp
2013-12-29 10:22:09	JosephFerano	right, that's the C# thing
2013-12-29 10:22:12	JosephFerano	it just uses that
2013-12-29 10:22:20	JosephFerano	well, do you think it's worth it, do you think it'll be faster?
2013-12-29 10:23:31	Watabou	YCM is definitely faster than neocomplcache so if you want to, you could give it a go. Even if it's a tiny bit faster, I think it will be worth it. I care a lot for speed
2013-12-29 10:23:40	JosephFerano	yeah
2013-12-29 10:23:46	JosephFerano	it's been a bit of a pain actually
2013-12-29 10:23:58	JosephFerano	I'll hit return, then starting typing "if" and it'll stall for a good second
2013-12-29 10:24:04	JosephFerano	while it brings up the autocompletion

2014-01-15 12:16:20	dhruvasagar	amcsi_work: why \x80 ? what's the intension ?
2014-01-15 12:16:38	amcsi_work	\x80 is the first non-ascii character

2014-01-15 12:20:59	pikaren	there's no substantial gain in speed when using vim i think
2014-01-15 12:21:22	dhruvasagar	pikaren: when you're talking about 'gain', you have to be talking in comparison to something else

2014-01-15 12:28:36	dhruvasagar	amcsi_work: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16987362/how-to-get-vim-to-highlight-non-ascii-characters I guess you've already read this ?

2014-01-15 12:29:10	DNZM	since you're trying to highlight PHP variables, why not go for the PHP docs first?
2014-01-15 12:29:10	DNZM	Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: '[a-zA-Z_-ÿ][a-zA-Z0-9_-ÿ]*'
2014-01-15 12:29:35	DNZM	...that's interesting, irssi ate my paste
2014-01-15 12:29:37	DNZM	http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.basics.php
2014-01-15 12:29:58	dhruvasagar	DNZM: didn't it ask you for ^k | ^c ?
2014-01-15 12:30:43	DNZM	only does that with >5 lines
2014-01-15 12:30:49	DNZM	it just ate the backslashes
2014-01-15 12:31:05	dhruvasagar	DNZM: generally it eats \asd
2014-01-15 12:31:09	DNZM	or maybe my terminal or tmux did, doesn't really matter, the regex is mentioned at the URL I pasted
2014-01-15 12:31:13	dhruvasagar	DNZM: backslashes in the start of text
2014-01-15 12:31:16	pikaren	can i open a hidden buffer as a split?
2014-01-15 12:31:25	dhruvasagar	pikaren: why not ?
2014-01-15 12:31:30	pikaren	how? :O
2014-01-15 12:31:40	dhruvasagar	pikaren: do you know the buffer name ?
2014-01-15 12:31:46	pikaren	:ls

2014-01-15 12:31:58	pikaren	or?
2014-01-15 12:32:08	DNZM	:hel sb
2014-01-15 12:32:17	DNZM	:ls gives you the buffer number
2014-01-15 12:32:26	DNZM	you can use the name too
2014-01-15 12:32:31	dhruvasagar	pikaren: :sbuffer
2014-01-15 12:32:43	amcsi_work	<dhruvasagar> I have, but the problem is that I also need to include ascii valid variable name characters as well. What you linked would exclude those which I don't want. I can dodge those ascii characters from the exclusion with that long range thing I already pasted, but I'm hoping for a cleaner, inclusion solution
2014-01-15 12:32:47	pikaren	ok thanks
2014-01-15 12:32:47	DNZM	it's tab-completable anyway
2014-01-15 12:33:10	amcsi_work	DNZM, you should think bytes
2014-01-15 12:33:28	amcsi_work	I think vim thinks characters, as opposed to PHP which thinks bytes
2014-01-15 12:33:30	dhruvasagar	amcsi_work: well you can use that idea to remove chars you don't want rather than select which you do, I suppose
2014-01-15 12:33:41	amcsi_work	ÿ is xFF
2014-01-15 12:33:47	dhruvasagar	amcsi_work: I am not really sure, is the php ftplugin not good enough for you ?
2014-01-15 12:34:04	dhruvasagar	amcsi_work: I meant php syntax*

2014-01-15 12:43:15	DNZM	as a more practical approach I'd just refrain from non-ascii chars in variable names in the first place, but that's me
