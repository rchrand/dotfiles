2013-11-11 21:07:40	ImBcmDth	pbodymind: 2) typed arrays are a LOT more memory efficient than regular arrays for dense stuff (like pixel data) 3) if you are allocating a lot of short-lived objects interspersed by a few longer-lived objects, you can run into "arena fragmentation" in firefox (they might have fixed this in more recent builds). FF allocates "arenas" that are (i think) a MB in size. only when EVERY object in an arena is GCd can the arena be freed. If even one byte
2013-11-11 21:07:40	ImBcmDth	hangs around, then whole arena is wasted.

2013-11-11 22:37:18	Wafamde	j201 - That makes sense
2013-11-11 22:37:26	phelix	yansanmo: one of the images is very large. So soon as the page loads I want it to display http://boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/sites/boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/themes/boguscreek/images/snow-bg.png in the background. And once the large image http://boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/sites/boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/themes/boguscreek/images/snow-large.gif is done loading. I want it
2013-11-11 22:37:26	phelix	to change the background url to that one instead.
2013-11-11 22:37:34	yansanmo	my fiddle says: load the img src (but doesn't display the img), when it's fully loaded, show it as background
2013-11-11 22:37:39	Wafamde	I did suspect that at one point, but had so many ideas floating around my head that I forgot to test that :D
2013-11-11 22:37:40	Wafamde	Thanks a million :)
2013-11-11 22:38:06	phelix	seems in that example you gave me there is only one image. Where it needs to change to the http://boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/sites/boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/themes/boguscreek/images/snow-large.gif once it is finished downloading.

2013-11-11 22:39:17	phelix	I am willing to do it whatever way works best. I just do not know much js =(
2013-11-11 22:39:22	phelix	Id rather not use an img tag at all
2013-11-11 22:39:27	phelix	just want it in the css

2013-11-11 22:41:53	phelix	good. I was hoping to not have that tag in there. I didn't want it in there anyway.
2013-11-11 22:42:02	phelix	But now while the large one is downloading. Can it display the smaller image in the process?
2013-11-11 22:42:25	yansanmo	what small  img?

2013-11-11 22:42:41	phelix	cause this background image is like 20Megs. Need the snow-bg.png needs to load while snow-large.gif is downloading
2013-11-11 22:43:05	GreenJello	phelix, turn snow-bg.png into a datauri
2013-11-11 22:43:15	GreenJello	scale it down a lot first
2013-11-11 22:43:19	phelix	so basically snow-bg.png is just a place holder to display until snow-large.gif finishes downloading
2013-11-11 22:43:36	yansanmo	then it should be the other way around...
2013-11-11 22:43:39	phelix	GreenJello the .gif is animated. I can't scale it down
2013-11-11 22:43:43	yansanmo	the png in the CSS, and the gif in the JS

I'm setting a scroll position on page load at the moment, and if it's a refresh I don't want it to go to that position because the browser automatically jumps back to its saved position after I set mine. Little bit annoying.

2013-11-12 17:24:55	caerphoto	possibly your app is using a private API or URLs or something

2013-11-12 17:25:18	caerphoto	it's not really a lot to go on, but it sounds like maybe your application is using an older version of IE to show the embedded view
2013-11-12 17:25:21	blits	would the URL help you determine if i posted it?

2013-11-12 19:11:24	TimTim`	well my gut is telling me i should avoid creating new instances if possible
2013-11-12 19:11:55	pothibo	TimTim`: Only thing you need to worry about is to avoid circular reference to a DOM entity and you should be good

2013-11-12 19:13:04	pierre1	Meaning, will google forbid my website from making ajax calls on the client-side after 2k requests or something?
2013-11-12 19:13:11	sukima	TimTim`: JS is designed to work with instances. use new at your hearts content ;)
2013-11-12 19:13:26	TimTim`	i mean right now for example, i'm creating a new instance of a User for every request (given their session)

2013-11-12 19:14:13	sukima	TimTim`: and whenthat scope is left or you set the reference to null V8 will garbage collect it in the background.
2013-11-12 19:14:29	zeekay	TimTim`: the overhead of creating a new instance is not going to bottleneck you

2013-11-12 19:15:09	sukima	Write code for readability only optimise if you HAVE to. Don't pre-optimise

2013-11-12 19:15:41	TimTim`	with each socket connection there's a chance some reference to each instance will remain

2013-11-12 19:15:58	TimTim`	and with thousands of connections it will add up quickly
2013-11-12 19:16:06	sukima	Then you have misbehaved code.
2013-11-12 19:16:30	TimTim`	well garbage collection is a bit delayed right?

2013-11-12 19:16:47	zeekay	you aren't goign to be creating new connections fast enough for this to matter
2013-11-12 19:17:04	TimTim`	at what interval does GC happen?
2013-11-12 19:17:10	-->	jorum has joined ##javascript
2013-11-12 19:17:19	-->	heedypo1 has joined ##javascript
2013-11-12 19:17:45	nowlan	still gc takes some time. blocking the execution of js.
2013-11-12 19:17:58	sukima	TimTim`: has your app crashed yet? Have you recieved memory warnings? Has your bandwidth been laging? If none of those then you ok. refacter only after one of those becomes a problem. Then profile the code to see where it is bottlenecked.
2013-11-12 19:18:19	TimTim`	a while back i did max out the memory
2013-11-12 19:18:19	zeekay	gc pause is not going to be noticeable in an IO bound app
2013-11-12 19:18:28	TimTim`	but it hasn't happened since i upgraded node and all packages
2013-11-12 19:18:34	zeekay	unless you are doing something really weird

2013-11-12 19:20:24	bradleymeck	which is kind of funny that the predictable version of GC had waaay more jank
2013-11-12 19:20:41	zeekay	you would need an absurdly high number of objects becoming unreachable every request for this to matter
2013-11-12 19:20:55	TimTim`	but regardless, if i'm able to reduce memory consumption to 1% of what it would be if i created new instances for every request... and given the delay on GC... it seems like it'd be something worth looking into

Given an array of strings, I'm doing arr.filter(function (d) { return d.indexOf(i.key) === 0 }) but for some reason indexOf always returns -1. i.key is a string key in a d3.map. If I console.log(d); console.log(i.key) I can *clearly* see that i.key is "http" and d is something like "http://someurl..." yet they're always -1...

2013-11-12 22:06:07	Deide	Others may say that you should bake the functionality into the client module itself to keep it singleton and parallel the 'client'.
2013-11-12 22:06:07	Deide	I'm not sure which would be the best way, and it may well depend on specific circumstances. I suppose figuring that out is really what you're paid for as a developer, haha.

2013-11-14 19:17:44	ImBcmDth	dwcook: i wish there was a `console.snapshot()` command to log the object as-is right now. And during a standard `console.log` there should be a button in the expanded object to "reload" the object to it's current state.

2013-11-14 19:19:22	ImBcmDth	so there is some IPC involved and I think it would make things terribly slow (especially for large or deeply nested objects) to log objects immediately.

2013-11-14 19:19:35	dwcook	Could be. But you end up doing that anyway if the console is open.

2013-11-14 22:28:21	dkeoui	I'm gonna zoom out a bit, because this may be a case of X/Y.
2013-11-14 22:28:24	Testerbit	Why on WWW.PBMG.CO when client login is clicked on nav bar, does it scroll up to home page instead of going to the link? Seems custom.js is interferring with a href? Wondering how to modify it so it does not?

2013-11-15 21:54:35	yogurt_truck	bradleymeck: JS is not "duck typed". JS is idiotically typed, I mean, dynamically typed. And "duck typing" is the workaround we use for having our functions work for certain types (because we all still need types at least conceptually, i.e. type FacebookUser, etc). If JS language had "built-in" duck typing, that'd improve things a bit. (some langs have this, and call it structural typing)

2013-11-24 16:39:33	Armistice	I was expecting if it's am atch it'd return an array containing the actual string in teh first place. otherwise null.
2013-11-24 16:39:38	dwcook	/[^0-9+*\/() -]/ means to match any one character as long as it isn't a digit, +, *, /, (, ), space, or -.
2013-11-24 16:39:57	dwcook	In the first example, no such character is found. In the latter, at least one is ('f').

2013-11-26 16:01:06	Maxdamantus	Wikipedia says something like: a monoid is a set of values, a unit value and an associative operation across them (with a couple more constraints).
2013-11-26 16:01:10	furrykef	I want to just give MSIE the finger (in which case I'll have at least one solution that works correctly), but it looks like about a quarter of users still use it for some reason.
2013-11-26 16:01:17	Maxdamantus	So those three things *ARE* the monoid.
2013-11-26 16:01:17	yogurt_truck	Maxdamantus: the mapping is not the functor
2013-11-26 16:01:30	Maxdamantus	which is exactly what are defined by a Monoid instance in Haskell.
2013-11-26 16:01:35	Sorella	Havvy: he did, back in the day. But I haven't seen him around lately
2013-11-26 16:01:38	Maxdamantus	except for the set of values.

2013-11-27 18:48:20	gavinlynch	Hi all. Quick question I would appreciate some help with: What is the common best practice for adding custom JS code to a project in relation to Namespacing?
2013-11-27 18:48:35	Sorella	gavinlynch: use a module system.
2013-11-27 18:48:39	Sorella	!modules @ gavinlynch
2013-11-27 18:48:39	ecmabot	gavinlynch: The current specification of ECMAScript doesn't define modules. Second-class modules are coming in ES6, but JS is powerful enough to encode first-class ones. Major implementations include AMD, CommonJS and Node modules (a modified CJS system). All of them can be used in any JS VM, including browsers. See also: http://killdream.github.io/2013/06/06/node-modules-to-rule-them-all.html

2013-11-28 13:17:46	ashnur	gordon__: other thing, this code can throw if either something or something.nextSibling is undefined. You said it throws only in IE so I assume it is because in both other browsers something.nextSibling is defined, and in IE for some reason it is not
2013-11-28 13:17:49	-->	schonert has joined ##javascript
2013-11-28 13:18:32	ashnur	the setAttribute thing is not a cure for your current issue, it's just good practice by my experience to set attributes on DOM nodes like that

2013-11-28 13:20:06	ashnur	gordon__: anyhow, you should have an `if ( something != null ) ` around everything and in the line with the nextSibling you should have `if ( something.nextSibling != null )`
2013-11-28 13:20:18	gordon__	ashnur: something.nextSibling is there

2013-11-28 13:21:22	gordon__	I'm saying that it's not null because I checked in debugger
2013-11-28 13:21:23	ashnur	or you just misunderstood what `something.nextSibling is undefined` means
2013-11-28 13:21:41	gordon__	I will try to add check
2013-11-28 13:21:56	<--	browndawg has quit (Quit: Leaving.)

2013-11-28 13:26:50	ashnur	maybe try deleting that last change ( .className != null ) and try setting it with setAttribute?

2013-11-28 13:27:50	ashnur	what do you mean? all those 3 lines are setting dom attributes, are they not?

2013-11-28 13:30:21	Maxdamantus	I think they used .className because `class' is a reserved word, and ES3 doesn't allow reserved words as non-string-literal-accessed properties.

2013-12-02 10:39:51	Maxdamantus	because if you define it using only those, with the expception of the possibly empty choice, you can always determine whether some string is a substring of a string in the language described by the parser.

2013-12-03 13:05:45	fabioportieri	yes

2013-12-03 16:16:33	fabioportieri	i have two events on the same element: one is a click event and the other is a "holding mousebutton" event.. how can i prevent race condition between the two, i.e. if click is triggered then holding should not fire and viceversa.. i guess unbound the other event as soon as the other starts and then rebound?

2013-12-03 18:15:59	Sorella	blackkbot, there are at least four models of OO in mainstream usage today: Classical OO, where you model things as blueprints, and work with instances of blueprints. Prototypical OO, where you don't have blueprints, only instances. Generic functions, where instead of objects you have multiple-dispatched functions. Protocols, where you have interfaces and implementations for those interfaces, functions are then dynamically selected from the po

2013-12-03 18:48:23	Sorella	jarek, `require` is actually much better than what you have in most languages.
2013-12-03 18:48:28	jarek	it's impossible to write frontend code without either polluting global space, wrapping your code with closures or using pre-processing/build tools

2013-12-03 19:29:21	Sorella	Havvy, currying transforms a function on tuples into a series of 1-argument functions. You can do it both ways, `uncurry (curry f)` is the same as `f`. Partial application fixes some parameter of `f` and returns a new function with that parameter fixed. There's no way of `unpartial (partial f a)`
2013-12-03 19:29:30	Havvy	Sorella:  Yes. I read the StackOverflow article.

2013-12-03 22:06:50	myndzi	damn :(
2013-12-03 22:07:32	myndzi	it would be okay to draw the marquee in canvas, but i'm not sure if it's easy to do the marching ants or whatever
2013-12-03 22:07:36	myndzi	with svg you can style it with css
2013-12-03 22:07:41	ryanw	You can work out the circle in canvas though
2013-12-03 22:07:56	ryanw	Then clip it with globalCompositeOperation
2013-12-03 22:08:02	ryanw	https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/canvas-tutorial/6_1_canvas_composite.html
2013-12-03 22:08:16	myndzi	should be able to use .clip too yeah?
2013-12-03 22:08:35	ryanw	maybe

2013-12-03 22:09:12	myndzi	i mean for canvas
2013-12-03 22:09:22	-->	tyfighter has joined ##javascript
2013-12-03 22:09:32	myndzi	i know i can create the path, .clip it, and copy the image over or something
2013-12-03 22:10:44	ryanw	oh yeah
2013-12-03 22:10:44	ryanw	that'll work
2013-12-03 22:10:44	myndzi	so the idea is to 1) copy the relevant portion of the original image
2013-12-03 22:10:44	myndzi	2) apply the filter/operation/whatever
2013-12-03 22:10:44	myndzi	3) copy the clipped section back

2013-12-03 22:10:44	ryanw	So just do the marching ants in svg, but everything else in canvas. Or use 2 canvases.

2013-12-03 22:12:02	myndzi	i'm not sure you want window.onload

2013-12-04 11:02:10	ssafejava	Alina-malina: you're making an ajax call with $.ajax(), right?
2013-12-04 11:02:17	ssafejava	or xmlhttprequest?

2013-12-04 11:03:03	Alina-malina	yes right $.ajax() sir
2013-12-04 11:03:09	ssafejava	ok
2013-12-04 11:03:11	-->	xec has joined ##javascript
2013-12-04 11:03:19	ssafejava	it's simple. use $.ajax as usual, and in your success handler, console.log the data
2013-12-04 11:03:21	ssafejava	I'll give you an example.
2013-12-04 11:03:50	Alina-malina	wait a minute when it make an ajax request json resposne comes back right?
2013-12-04 11:03:57	Alina-malina	i want to know where that json is stored to access it
2013-12-04 11:04:04	Alina-malina	i can see a JSON object
2013-12-04 11:04:12	Alina-malina	but what variable is that? how to access it from consoel
2013-12-04 11:04:17	ssafejava	$.ajax({url: "/endpoint"}).done(function(data){ console.log(data);});
2013-12-04 11:04:19	Alina-malina	is it being cleaned after it comes?
2013-12-04 11:04:29	ssafejava	you can't access it from console, you have to get it from your code, because it's only defined inside that done function
2013-12-04 11:04:39	ssafejava	it's not deposited into the global scope where you could just get it from your console.
2013-12-04 11:04:45	ssafejava	if it were, it would live forever and fill up memory
2013-12-04 11:04:51	<--	shaunbaker has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-04 11:04:56	ssafejava	so if you don't use it in that success callback, it is essentially removed.
2013-12-04 11:05:29	ssafejava	some people use $.ajax's `success` attribute in the same way. `$.ajax({url: '/endpoint', success: function(data){ console.log(data); } });`

2013-12-04 11:47:47	MrBig	id like to use js to create a standalone desktop console app (windows,macosx,linux) where the source isnt distributed, i was using C# but, if i could just use JS it would be so much easier, any ideas? (if i could use node.js packages on it, would rule)

2013-12-04 12:49:15	Sorella	faustFederel, JSON is about data, it's kind of difficult to encode the kinds of functions you have in JavaScript in such format, specially due to closures and stuff. It is also rather unsafe

2013-12-04 15:44:52	Alina-malina	kamoricks, ok, i want a javascript  framework that allow to create html pages, formating them like wordpress, but in javascript and store the stuff in json format, what i should start from?
2013-12-04 15:44:54	kamoricks	Zak: Right. So depend on one of them. Jquery is popular, backbone is much smaller, and so on, and so forth.
2013-12-04 15:45:28	Zak	kamoricks: would it be reasonable for the developer to be asked to connect one up?

2013-12-04 16:30:44	Sorella	Sendoushi, this is not a trivial problem. It requires largely sofisticated natural language processing and sentiment analysis. You can't just "check for profanity"
2013-12-04 16:30:54	Sorella	And then, I don't think it's worth it
2013-12-04 16:30:59	thegladiator	fine thanks . Sorella .
2013-12-04 16:30:59	Sendoushi	you can if you decide to do just something simple
2013-12-04 16:31:00	Sorella	Not for the use cases you've presented
2013-12-04 16:31:07	Sendoushi	i'm not talking about a software which only do profanity
2013-12-04 16:31:09	bittyx-work	Also, someone could use perfectly "nice" language and still say bad things.

2013-12-04 16:31:27	thegladiator	I am sure there are profinty checking tools out there . basically the idea is you have a list of black listed words
2013-12-04 16:31:38	Sorella	Profanity is no different from any other word.
2013-12-04 16:31:54	Sorella	And is by far not the words that cause the worst impact these days
2013-12-04 16:31:56	Sorella	BY FAR
2013-12-04 16:32:01	yorick	profanity makes no sense

2013-12-04 18:07:02	manou	Hi, I am bloqued and frustated in one point. It is related to canvas. If you have time, please take a look http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20352190/html5-composite-operations-in-ie and comment there, I have to go now ... I will check comments after a while. I will appreciate any expert can help me. I guess the problem is the management of images loading.

2013-12-04 21:13:23	joepie91	how certain can I be that a list in JSON has its order preserved? in my particular case, it'd be serialized by Tornado in a Python application to be sent through a websocket (I assume Tornado uses the standard JSON library in Python?) and deserialized in the browser

2013-12-04 21:15:02	sparr	http://jsfiddle.net/sparr/78XQb/ I would like to write a userscript that modifies the behavior of this fiddle, such that when your ip is displayed the string is modified in some way first. How would I go about accomplishing that?
2013-12-04 21:15:18	sacho	joepie91, if you serialize the list into an array, deserializing it will always yield the same order
2013-12-04 21:15:51	sacho	as for object, you can be reasonably certain, but I'd advise just using an array if you want order
2013-12-04 21:15:55	joepie91	and there are no known implementation differences that I am likely to encounter?
2013-12-04 21:15:58	joepie91	my case is an array

2013-12-04 21:16:16	sacho	no, arrays are explicitly ordered

2013-12-04 21:16:42	joepie91	lethjakman: browser-based things have a long history of implementation differences, I figured I'd check before relying on it
2013-12-04 21:17:01	sacho	well, as long as the python part is serializing it into the array as you expect
2013-12-04 21:17:02	lethjakman	ahhh fair enough. yeah json's just a string so unless you're using  a weird parser it should stay the same (never heard of that happening though.)
2013-12-04 21:17:27	joepie91	alright - I know that the spec mandates them to be ordered, but practical experiences are always useful as a double check

2013-12-04 21:21:35	sacho	joepie91, the json spec only states how to format an array, if you want an array, it doesn't specify, for example, that a python list is to be converted to an array, or that it'll be converted in an order, and so on(essentially, the toJSON() and fromJSON() aren't specified, only the format is)

2013-12-04 21:22:14	joepie91	and python lists are indeed ordered

Feel free that share a sample when you get it working because I'll be doing something very similar before too long. For the droppables, there are lots of jQuery plugs and then tools like Kendo (which uses jQuery but is it's own framework rather than a plugin).

2013-12-04 22:07:25	Korvin	if you want to check if obj1 has all the same properties as obj2, you can just loop through obj1 and test that
2013-12-04 22:07:29	rainabba	Vandelay: They provide a demo: http://jsbin.com/aliniz/2
2013-12-04 22:07:35	Korvin	if you want to check if they are exactly the same, you have to loop through both
2013-12-04 22:07:52	bberry	i need the former, thanks :D
2013-12-04 22:08:09	rainabba	Vandelay: Kind of a limited approach though.
2013-12-04 22:08:22	bberry	Korvin: ^^
2013-12-04 22:08:26	Korvin	it will be a deep comparison if you test if obj.object_property == obj2.object_property
2013-12-04 22:08:33	bberry	true

2013-12-04 22:08:40	bberry	for my caswe
2013-12-04 22:08:45	Korvin	so if you want it to not be deep, you need to ignore objects
2013-12-04 22:08:45	rainabba	bberry: JSONIFY the objects and compare the strings
2013-12-04 22:08:45	bberry	yeah
2013-12-04 22:08:54	dman777_alter	which would be less resource intensive? a side scroller using CSS or using Javascript?

2013-12-04 22:09:56	dman777_alter	in general, which is less resource intensive for animation effects...javascript or css? I'm developing a webpage to run on rasberry pi which is low on resources....very weak. I want to place a side scrolling info bar in without jerkyness
2013-12-04 22:10:17	<--	petey has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2013-12-04 22:10:25	rainabba	bberry: So what are you REALLY trying to determine?
2013-12-04 22:10:47	Korvin	rainabba: no one said "same object"
2013-12-04 22:10:56	GreenJello	dman777_alter, they're probably about the same, but CSS animations will get faster over time

2013-12-04 22:11:11	Korvin	converting to JSON will be heavier than looping through the object anyway
2013-12-04 22:11:27	rainabba	Korvin: You're right. He did say "compare two objects" not "test for equality or similarity"
2013-12-04 22:11:30	dman777_alter	GreenJello: I hate rasberry pi, it's so restricting in what I can do

2013-12-04 22:12:00	rainabba	GreenJello: Right?
2013-12-04 22:12:02	bberry	haha. basically i have two arrays of objects. each object has 3 or so key:value pairs at the uppermost level that make them unique.  Before i push an object into array 1, i want to make sure its not in array 2.

2013-12-04 22:13:10	sacho	..grep?
2013-12-04 22:13:16	rainabba	Unless he doesn't know what the left side looks like then a guess you'd have to look that side.
2013-12-04 22:13:16	bberry	i think its jquery
2013-12-04 22:13:39	rainabba	sacho: A way to search arrays basically. Docs :)
2013-12-04 22:13:43	bberry	yeah its a jquery function
2013-12-04 22:13:50	bberry	kinda nifty

2013-12-04 22:14:06	rainabba	I use it in queues regularly. VERY helpful.
2013-12-04 22:14:17	sacho	that does the same thing
2013-12-04 22:14:26	rainabba	inArray() (think that's the name) is similar but not as powerful.
2013-12-04 22:14:36	rainabba	jQuery has their own implementation of inArray()
2013-12-04 22:14:38	sacho	no different than using Array.prototype.filter()

2013-12-05 09:04:07	GreenJello	teufelChiCoder, use something like Knockout or Ember

2013-12-05 09:12:51	GreenJello	teufelChiCoder, with my experience, I'd use KnockoutJS on the client, and NodeJS with MongoDB on the server.  Then it's Database -> Server -> Client -> Server -> Database, and everything stays in JSON so it's super easy.
2013-12-05 09:12:53	teufelChiCoder	Agamemnus, i don't mind going "adventurous" way, but depends
2013-12-05 09:13:14	teufelChiCoder	GreenJello hmmm tha'ts quiet a combo

2013-12-05 14:58:36	masak	Dell02_: they we probably thinking that a lot of other things are zero-based, so why not months, too?

2013-12-08 12:09:00	xfce-x64	ok Sir
2013-12-08 12:09:19	xfce-x64	So what is HTML5 ?? is html programmable or is it html+css+js?

2013-12-08 12:09:50	xfce-x64	Are you guiding me to be a HTML5 dev ?
2013-12-08 12:10:03	pixelpimp	It's entirely separate from CSS and JS, just like all other HTMLs.  But most people tend to associate all three together
2013-12-08 12:10:16	GreenJello	xfce-x64, when people say HTML5 they usually mean HTML5+CSS3+ECMA5
2013-12-08 12:10:35	xfce-x64	ECMA5?
2013-12-08 12:10:38	GreenJello	html5 actually isn't very different from html4
2013-12-08 12:11:27	GreenJello	xfce-x64, JS is an implementation of ECMAScript; version 5 includes a lot of nice features that didn't exist in old JS

2013-12-08 13:14:38	ashnur	refactoring is what programmers do. navigating code is not dependent on any platform, i find vim to be the easiest for that for example. and code completion is something I thought it was important but then somehow i just never used it for anything than 2-3 variables maximum in each of my files.

2013-12-08 13:17:00	ashnur	and tbh. i don't think the editor should matter in any way. it is a tool, should do what it is intended for it, nothing fancy, nothing too much, and should definitely not get in the way of the user. so it depends how you like to code

2013-12-08 15:56:00	Sorella	Hannibal_Smith: the core concept of structural typing/coding on top of interfaces is solid. Modules are basically this. I'm not much of a fan of the classical OO school of thought, but multiple-delegated prototypes, multi-methods and typeclasses/protocols are pretty good.
2013-12-08 15:56:40	Sorella	Protocols being "restricted" multi-methods

2013-12-08 19:41:02	onur	Hi guys. I kinda understand oop js. I have class 'A'. I am making prototypes for methods with A.prototype.mymethod. How can I defined a prototype for a variable in this class? I need A.b.c?
2013-12-08 19:41:42	onur	I tried A.prototype.b.prototype but didn't work
2013-12-08 19:41:54	Havvy	onur:  Object.create(prototype) allows you to create an object with a prototype of a specific object.
2013-12-08 19:42:38	Havvy	Otherwise, you'd have to create a constructor function for b (probably called B) and then do  `A.prototype.b = new B();`

2013-12-08 22:49:35	Sorella	Taggnostr: making a function use continuations just involves replacing all `return a` by `continuation(a)`, and `return f(a)` with `f(a, continuation)`
2013-12-08 22:50:26	Taggnostr	Sorella, what should I pass to find_paths as continuation function?
2013-12-08 22:50:46	Sorella	Taggnostr: whatever you want to receive the result of the find_paths function.
2013-12-08 22:51:08	Sorella	var x = find_paths(a, b, c); is equivalent to `find_paths(a, b, c, function(x){ ... })` in CPS

2013-12-08 22:56:33	Taggnostr	I wonder if it's easier to just put the results in a queue and have something reading them from there every 1s and calling draw_path()
2013-12-08 22:56:38	Sorella	Taggnostr: right, you just need to wrap the `if ((...))` part in a setTimeout

2013-12-10 16:31:17	j201	jarek: what i meant is that they're providing more tools for the constructor-less approach

2013-12-10 16:31:48	jarek	j201: yeah, but all those tools are low level and aimed at framework authors

2013-12-10 17:14:14	Sorella	I will optimise it after I've finished some lower level monadic libraries I'm working on, since a few applications at work are relying on it, and it would be cool to have some more speed

So what should be a good way to judge the sentiment. By which I mean, if he/she is just wandering or say looking for something or even is not able to see some parts of the website.

2013-12-18 16:41:47	ecmabot	moofy: ‘Hoisting’ is the name given to the mechanism whereby names defined with ‘var’ or function declarations (see !fe) are made available throughout their scope, even before the declaration is encountered textually.  Beware: though the *definition* of a variable is available, its value (if given) will be undefined until the var declaration is encountered or the variable is otherwise assigned to.
2013-12-18 16:41:50	moofy	I just wanted to understand why rather than just doing it

I'm playing around with a node + socket.io + redis javascript server and I'm finding with the redis calls there is a daisy chain of callbacks that I need to make in order to do some basic processing.  This is not how I would normally do things in another language, like python or some such, where I would block until the DB request was finished to proceed to the next step.

2013-12-27 18:34:31	Havvy	Yes, they are.
2013-12-27 18:34:33	winterpk	I want an IDE though

2013-12-27 18:35:56	systemfault	For me, it depends on the task... If I need to do frontend + backend, an IDE is better for me... For just frontend, an editor alone is fine (I love macvim and sublime text)

The biggest challenge of the project was figuring out which of the 11 was breaking what, and if fixing it broke an undocumented feature somewhere.  It was really fun when our graphing library changed how Array "for in" loops worked.  It was just as frustrating to learn we were using "for in" for arrays.

2013-12-28 13:11:40	GreenJello	arphen, general about the site: the login panel's animation is weird.  I generally like the file manager, but anyone can upload files (even if not logged in), but if an anon uploads a file, not even the admin can remove it.  A loading message would be nice, because it feels like nothin is happening when I click Materials.  You should preload the scripts needed for materials, but do so asynchronusly so it doesn't impact th
2013-12-28 13:11:40	GreenJello	e homepage's load time.  It would benifit from real URLs so someone can link to certain pages.  You're making requests to, e.g., "/materials" which is sending a 301 for "/materials/" resulting in a wasted request.

2013-12-28 13:14:49	GreenJello	ererw5q, google maps probably has some kind of point-plotting functionality, so you just have to research it, and transform those objects into that format

2013-12-28 14:48:00	pipecloud	Maybe you could use it for a super slow retrieval mechanism of data, rather than 'backup' per se. Like, you want to make acquiring that data painful, so  you encrypt it well and glacier it. Then a malicious person needs to wait hours before even getting the file and being able to try decrypting it.
