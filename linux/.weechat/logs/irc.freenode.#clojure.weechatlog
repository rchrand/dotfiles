2013-11-11 18:04:21	cemerick	dnolen: The original use case was being able to change test-time parameters. There are workarounds, including the config function notion, having a fixture that looks up params set from the test runner on window, etc.

2013-11-11 18:06:19	cemerick	What ^:export does now is pretty surprising tho.  If someone wants some low-hanging contrib fruit, documenting that @ https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start#using-clojurescript-on-a-web-page (the only place I know of that mentions ^:export?) would be one such spot.

2013-11-11 18:07:18	dnolen	cemerick: you're one of the few people that have asked for this or been surprised by the behavior. ^:export is mostly used for exporting functions note constants that will be mutated as this isn't considered good CLJS style. The testing case is not even particularly interesting IMO since it's trivially worked around.

2013-11-11 18:10:32	cemerick	dnolen: Fair enough, I'm not lobbying hard or anything. :-)  My understanding of ^:export was that it was primarily there to provide entry points and to make providing JS-friendly APIs (where mutable properties are common).

2013-11-11 20:39:15	amalloy	danneu: that is totally wrong. transients do not make data structures mutable
2013-11-11 20:39:21	danneu	damn

2013-11-11 20:39:42	amalloy	they permit the data structures to use mutability as an optimization; they do not allow you to mutate them without restraint
2013-11-11 20:39:44	technomancy	welllll. not *totally* wrong.
2013-11-11 20:39:47	technomancy	just misses the point.
2013-11-11 20:39:59	danneu	yeah, it was too haste a simplification

2013-11-11 20:40:10	danneu	too dumb*
2013-11-11 20:40:22	danneu	i really just wanted to share the link
2013-11-11 20:40:28	nDuff	...more than that, one can't assume that calculating a mutated version of a transient will change it.
2013-11-11 20:40:33	nDuff	one simply can't assume that doing so _won't_.

2013-11-11 20:45:25	danneu	Question: Some contributors on my project have started bikeshedding about my preference to refer to coordinates as {:x _, :y _} instead of a tuple [x y]. [x y] is only nice if you're always destructuring it. but otherwise, (coords 0) and (coords 1) are heinous to my eyes.

2013-11-11 20:53:26	cYmen	Could somebody please explain this to me: Also, in some cases keys can be used as functions of maps. For example, keyword keys can, but string and integer keys cannot.
2013-11-11 20:53:53	`cbp	,(:a {:a 1})
2013-11-11 20:53:55	clojurebot	1
2013-11-11 20:54:02	cYmen	I apparently have no useful notion of what a keyword is internally.
2013-11-11 20:54:23	cYmen	Because I am very surprised that it can be looked up in a way that allows using it as a function.

2013-11-11 20:54:32	cYmen	Wouldn't that require knowing that it is in a map?

2013-11-11 21:36:20	mdrogalis	There was a good talk by Stu Halloway about why. Can't remember which one.
2013-11-11 21:36:25	tbaldridge	llasram: they make code harder to test, and manage imo. It's much better to put your public API in a different ns. Put all the "private" stuff somewhere else.
2013-11-11 21:36:26	mdrogalis	It was just a slide or two, but he nailed it..
2013-11-11 21:36:34	danneu	:private is mostly helpful for me as the developer since a namespace is otherwise an interleave of "public" functions and helper functions

2013-11-11 21:44:18	TimMc	I tend to use :private if *most* of my namespace is intended to be public and people should be able to use ns-publics to browse it.

2013-11-11 21:44:36	llasram	tbaldridge: I feel the same way in languages like Java, but I've never had a problem accessing a :private Clojure var when I needed it :-)
2013-11-11 21:44:38	TimMc	I also make dangerous fns private -- ones that back safer interfaces.

2013-11-11 21:45:12	mikerod	private functions are sort of a "code smell" of non-reusable code aren't they? :)
2013-11-11 21:45:37	TimMc	If I have only a couple of API fns in a namespace, I just list them in the namespace's docstring and default to leaving things public.
2013-11-11 21:45:42	mikerod	I guess not if you are using it all over in a lib of some sort, but you don't wnat others to get involved with it
2013-11-11 21:45:50	mdrogalis	There are probably more valuable problems you can spend your brain cycles on that something small like this :)
2013-11-11 21:45:57	mdrogalis	Than*
2013-11-11 21:46:05	noonian	yeah i think they are mainly used to hide things that aren't part of the public api
2013-11-11 21:46:08	TimMc	The problem is that namespaces conflate namespacing and APIs.

2013-11-11 21:50:40	dnolen	tbaldridge: it seems it would be possible to improve core.async source map support w/o waiting on that ticket no? but I guess you would need to change core.async macros to pass around line/col info

2013-11-12 18:11:37	S11001001	Morgawr: that's not to say that sequential circumscribes the domain of `seq'; for that, you need seqable? from core.incubator

2013-11-14 20:15:51	egosum	I was just wondering if someone has worked on a nice translator yet :) seems like something that would be useful. I mean, Datomic has one somehow haha

2013-11-14 20:17:28	egosum	bitemyapp: would be a fun research project. I'm finding some papers related to it
2013-11-14 20:17:43	egosum	Some older code as well
2013-11-14 20:18:10	egosum	Would be immensely useful, for me at least
2013-11-14 20:18:18	bitemyapp	I don't totally see why
2013-11-14 20:18:37	bitemyapp	but again, any translator couldn't be fully general, which sucks.
2013-11-14 20:18:38	nDuff	egosum: well, if you only wanted something similar to datomic's backend (one big kvs table), that's a bit different.
2013-11-14 20:19:02	nDuff	egosum: (than a fully general translator to realistic relational schemas)
2013-11-14 20:19:12	mdrogalis	I'm gonna try an alternate query engine for Datomic. It will probably go terribly. But I'll do it anyway

2013-11-14 20:54:40	nDuff	...in particular, due to the way IFn is constructed, you've got less flexibility in your calling conventions when using them.
2013-11-14 20:54:44	satshabad	right, I wouldn't want to do that all over, maybe just in a tight loop if i needed to speed something up
2013-11-14 20:54:58	satshabad	and being aware of what i was passing it to
2013-11-14 20:55:04	nDuff	*nod*.
2013-11-14 20:55:16	nDuff	It's also easy, if uncautious, to have constant boxing/unboxing going on
2013-11-14 20:55:26	nDuff	...which can quickly get less efficient than just leaving things boxed all the time.
2013-11-14 20:55:44	satshabad	right. if I (int 1) and then pass it to a non type hinted func, it will unbox and then box.

2013-11-14 21:46:55	amalloy	i'm surprised you're seeing much time there - it does very little work, and unless you create a lot of functions you never call, i'd think the time taken calling them would dominate
2013-11-14 21:47:00	amalloy	of course
2013-11-14 21:47:10	amalloy	although #(inc %) is just a bad way to write inc
2013-11-14 21:47:18	joegallo	poppingtonic: you already have a function named pprint in your ns, and you're trying to pull in clojure.data.json, which also has one

2013-11-14 22:59:20	justin_smith	satshabad: its the classic problem of many interop setups - in theory you can just call to a more efficient but less featureful / safe language, but then you end up burning cycles converting from native to unsafe datatypes

2013-11-14 23:03:18	-->	ly- has joined #clojure
2013-11-14 23:03:39	justin_smith	the general idea is to try to segregate your algorithm, make the boundaries between array-using and vector-using code explicit, and make sure it is crossed as rarely as you can get away with
2013-11-14 23:04:03	-->	mercwithamouth has joined #clojure
2013-11-14 23:04:47	satshabad	yeah that makes sense. So for matrix mult, I would want to accept vectors, but maybe convert to arrays right away and use those until I have a result. Then convert back.
2013-11-14 23:04:53	-->	ystael has joined #clojure
2013-11-14 23:05:00	justin_smith	right
2013-11-14 23:05:05	satshabad	otherwise parts of my code will have array and part will have vector

2013-11-14 23:06:50	satshabad	as far as I can gather, use a transient when you need to speed up conj, assoc, etc. use an array when you need to _____
2013-11-14 23:06:57	satshabad	why use array over transient?

2013-11-15 20:17:48	bitemyapp	arrdem: issue tracking is a workflow issue and people are too persnickety about it. Version control should be neutral territory.
2013-11-15 20:17:59	bitemyapp	arrdem: "complecting" things together instead of making composable tools isn't the answer.

2013-11-15 20:19:32	arrdem	bitemyapp: I guess so. Really all I want is an issue tracking system that integrates nicely with my entirely emacs/zsh based workflow. The real answer is probably to just run a $ROOT/.git and an ignored $ROOT/issues/ with a seperate .git...
2013-11-15 20:19:43	bitemyapp	arrdem: that's org-mode dude.

2013-11-15 20:21:15	bitemyapp	seangrove: is it a simple KV query pattern or do you need to query the contents?
2013-11-15 20:21:32	bitemyapp	technomancy: well, I legitimately didn't know arrdem needed anybody but himself to use his issue tracking.

2013-11-15 20:23:11	bitemyapp	seangrove: then either way can work, but the reason for using HStore is so you query against the contents.

2013-11-20 22:10:59	satshabad	I am starting to try out compjure for something and I haev a question. If I have an endpoint that needs to make a couple http requests, aggragate the response and then return a result, would the bet way to do that be using let blocks? e.g. let result1 ... result2 ... in (aggregate result1 result2) ?
2013-11-20 22:11:08	satshabad	i feel like it gets too nested....
2013-11-20 22:11:25	satshabad	is there any way to do it with (do .. .. ...)?

2013-11-20 22:11:50	satshabad	also whats' a good why of handling failure in that senario?
2013-11-20 22:12:18	satshabad	if any 1 connection fails, I want the whole things to return a 404 or something
2013-11-20 22:12:26	justin_smith	satshabad: if you want to get the results in parallel (likely a good plan), then that may be a good cantidate for a go block using core.async

2013-11-20 22:13:03	satshabad	hmmm, but what if I need them to be in series? result2 depends on result1, etc...

2013-11-24 17:37:39	xcthulhu	Hey, I'm a clojure noob and I just read some code where someone wrote (def- ^{:const true} blah "blah")
2013-11-24 17:37:53	xcthulhu	Is that idiomatic for private constants?

2013-11-24 17:38:08	justin_smith	def- is idiomatic for private things
2013-11-24 17:38:21	justin_smith	I don't know if :const actually does anything though, maybe someone else does
2013-11-24 17:38:51	Bronsa	:const actually does something

2013-11-24 17:39:17	justin_smith	that's good to know
2013-11-24 17:39:29	justin_smith	how does it interact with redefinition?
2013-11-24 17:39:37	Bronsa	it breaks it

2013-11-24 17:39:45	justin_smith	thanks, that's useful
2013-11-24 17:40:09	justin_smith	so I should wait until my code is "done" before adding const hints I guess
2013-11-24 17:40:19	-->	Joreji_ has joined #clojure
2013-11-24 17:40:22	xcthulhu	Yeah, it's a premature optimization...
2013-11-24 17:40:27	Bronsa	justin_smith: the rationale is that if you explicitely use ^:const you know what you're doing.
2013-11-24 17:40:29	<--	ewnd9 has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2013-11-24 17:40:32	justin_smith	right
2013-11-24 17:40:58	justin_smith	so basically, if I find something is getting looked up too often in a tight loop, use :const, otherwise just leave it be
2013-11-24 17:41:38	Bronsa	if it's a constant, yeah
2013-11-24 17:41:47	justin_smith	of course
2013-11-24 17:42:17	justin_smith	but most top level stuff in good clojure code should be constants
2013-11-24 17:42:26	TimMc	And even then, shouldn't hotspot help out?
2013-11-24 17:42:34	TimMc	and branch prediction

2013-11-24 17:42:43	justin_smith	it would be interesting to see a comparison
2013-11-24 17:43:32	TimMc	It would be interesting to have everything be constants by default in production, but make everything rebindable during (say) lein test.
2013-11-24 17:44:06	TimMc	test, repl... not sure what else

2013-11-24 17:45:37	xcthulhu	TimMc: Well, I was wondering because I have some parsing code and I want to use a gensym for an EOF symbol... in this case, dereferencing is the right thing to do, rather than inlining

2013-11-24 17:46:17	justin_smith	xcthulhu: then you probably wouldn't want to use :const anyway

2013-11-24 17:46:55	xcthulhu	Also, which is better: (gensym) or (Object.) ?

2013-11-24 17:50:07	justin_smith	xcthulhu: you probably want Object.
2013-11-24 17:50:19	xcthulhu	TimMc: Right.  But explicitly writing (gensym) seems like a rare event

2013-11-24 20:09:46	bellkev	I answered my own question from earlier about why there are both deftype and defrecord constructs by reading this: http://clojure.org/datatypes. However, as I start to play with records, I wonder: what do most people do for data validation? For example, if I create records with (map->RecordName {...}), it is okay if fields are missing or if there are extra keys not defined as fields on the record. Do people tend to perform validations separat
2013-11-24 20:09:46	bellkev	like this: http://blog.8thlight.com/myles-megyesi/2012/10/16/data-validation-in-clojure.html ?

2013-11-24 20:17:21	bellkev	Maybe it's less necessary for me to even use the defrecord versus just a hashmap in the first place then, because it's doesn't need to do any protocol-ish stuff. Is it typical in clojure to use defrecords for field groupings only just to be explicit about what the record is, versus just using an anonymous map?
2013-11-24 20:17:45	justin_smith	usually defrecord is for performance
2013-11-24 20:17:51	justin_smith	or protocol stuff

2013-11-25 13:08:42	johiddini	Hi - compojure/ring question. I have a compojure app, works great in development, but now I want to properly deploy it. How can I run my uberjar as a service that starts when my EC2 instance does, and automatically restarts if it crashes? I'm not an ops guy so maybe I'm missing the obvious.

2013-11-27 17:41:23	seangrove	I'd like to turn on source maps (haven't used them personally yet), but the overhead is a bit high with :whitespace optimization

2013-11-27 17:42:54	dnolen	seangrove: oh but you're probably doing this on huge codebase?
2013-11-27 17:43:01	seangrove	Ok, that's acceptable then. Was pleasantly surprised to see my :whitespace optimization on a small-ish codebase recompiling in ~0.5-1s
2013-11-27 17:43:08	seangrove	Will try turning on source maps
2013-11-27 17:43:18	dnolen	seangrove: yeah source maps don't add much overhead
2013-11-27 17:43:40	seangrove	But when avoiding any optimizations, do you manually add each generated js file to the html files you're working with?
2013-11-27 17:43:46	dnolen	IME, but I haven't tried on huge amounts of CLJS

2013-11-27 19:14:30	technomancy	no idea
2013-11-27 19:15:15	seangrove	dnolen: No, it's json which is parsed and then converted into clj data structures, but then running lots of filters, maps, reduces over it, etc.

2013-11-27 19:15:53	seangrove	Trying to see how much we can keep client side to keep ui iteration fast. And then see if it's possible to pin point the bottlenecks and speed it up enough for daily use
2013-11-27 19:16:00	seangrove	Ah, yes, good point
2013-11-27 19:16:13	gfredericks	gtrak: it would be weird if (last x) and (last (seq x)) didn't return the same thing
2013-11-27 19:16:20	gtrak	gfredericks: I also think it's bad to rely on key order, but it's nice that keys followed by vals line up.
2013-11-27 19:16:34	dnolen	seangrove: I would be surprised if those filter/maps/reduces are bottlenecks though - unless it's a crazy amount of data
2013-11-27 19:17:00	seangrove	dnolen: I don't think it's a crazy amount of data, so it'll be interesting to start pinning it down
2013-11-27 19:17:27	gtrak	gfredericks: I don't think that would be weird for unordered data.  You wouldn't notice it until you impose an order.
2013-11-27 19:17:36	dnolen	seangrove: I spent a ton of time optimizing lazyseqs some time ago - very close to JVM there under V8 and looks fine elsewhere

2013-11-27 19:22:42	dnolen	seangrove: still this may be an argument to switch to reducers in the near term

2013-11-27 19:28:07	drorbemet	Hi, I am trying to pull parse large xml (> 200Gb) in clojure. Is StAX supposed to be the pull parser for the JVM? I tried to count the elements in a large xml file using clojure/data.xml which uses StAX, but I got an out of memory exeption. Do you know some code samples that show how to avoid building up large values in mamory while pull parsing xml in clojure?

2013-11-27 19:29:01	aconbere	this is a useful generic representation of a command, and easy to parse into and serialize from

2013-11-27 19:29:28	gtrak	drorbemet: if the head end of the seq is bound, then those elements can't be garbage collected, and the entire thing would have to fit in memory during a count.

2013-11-27 19:30:49	aconbere	S11001001: right so I mean the way I would approach specialization is have a step that converts from the specialized representation to the easy to serialize one

2013-11-28 13:10:22	noprompt	bitemyapp: i'll remove CSSGen and Gaka for you. :P
2013-11-28 13:10:30	 *	justin_smith goes and starts working on the "opinionated loudmouths" section of the wiki.
2013-11-28 13:10:52	bitemyapp	justin_smith: I'm not even sure what that would entail.

2013-11-28 13:12:29	noprompt	actually, i'm not trying to be a douce here but cssgen hasn't been touched in two years and one of Gaka's last commit messages is "Update to clojure 1.4.0"
2013-11-28 13:12:31	ben_m	Anyone know why nREPL quits after I close Quil sketches?

2013-11-28 13:12:58	bitemyapp	noprompt: k, I'll kill 'em.
2013-11-28 13:13:07	CookedGryphon	ben_m: the default behaviour on closing a jframe is system.exit
2013-11-28 13:13:14	justin_smith	noprompt: sometimes something is simple enough that it is just done, that doesn't make it stop being useful
2013-11-28 13:13:32	justin_smith	now if they have multiple unaddressed issues on their repo on the other hand
2013-11-28 13:13:51	sm0ke	i also found https://github.com/paraseba/lein-reload, but it doesnt seems to be working
2013-11-28 13:13:51	noprompt	justin_smith: this is certainly true.
2013-11-28 13:13:57	bitemyapp	justin_smith: I'm willing to believe that, but people should just be directed to Garden.
2013-11-28 13:14:15	bitemyapp	if I want to emphasize a particular library, I'll put a "Recommended" next to it in future.
2013-11-28 13:15:08	-->	Sorella_ has joined #clojure
2013-11-28 13:15:15	noprompt	justin_smith: garden does have open issues, some of which are not really issues, other's like this one: https://github.com/noprompt/garden/issues/23 are pretty much a crap shoot.
2013-11-28 13:15:37	CookedGryphon	ben_m: at least that's a thing I remember being an issue, can't remember the exact details now I've said it
2013-11-28 13:15:43	noprompt	the issues on garden right now are mainly feature oriented.
2013-11-28 13:15:52	ben_m	CookedGryphon, yeah that makes sense, it doesn't work though and on-close isn't an option if I (doc sketch)
2013-11-28 13:16:30	CookedGryphon	ben_m: and you're using defsketch and not putting it in something else?
2013-11-28 13:16:38	justin_smith	well garden hasn't seen a change in master in two years from what I see
2013-11-28 13:16:44	--	poppingt` is now known as poppingtonic
2013-11-28 13:16:49	noprompt	say wut?

2013-11-28 13:17:08	justin_smith	wait, don't mind me
2013-11-28 13:17:13	justin_smith	need my coffee
2013-11-28 13:17:19	justin_smith	I was looking at cssgen
2013-11-28 13:17:24	noprompt	justin_smith: the version was bumped 9 days ago. haha!
2013-11-28 13:17:25	ben_m	CookedGryphon, I was using sketch instead of defsketch. Works now :D
2013-11-28 13:17:42	CookedGryphon	ben_m: oh, odd, were you making your own frame?
2013-11-28 13:17:53	noprompt	lol
2013-11-28 13:18:00	CookedGryphon	ben_m: I would recommend finding out what was wrong and going back to sketch, defsketch is bad for many reasons
2013-11-28 13:18:05	noprompt	justin_smith: everyone has those moments. :)
2013-11-28 13:18:06	ben_m	No, just using sketch, I assumed it was just defsketch without giving it a name.
2013-11-28 13:18:06	justin_smith	it would be cool if the list of libs mentioned the time since last activity on github

2013-11-28 13:19:58	CookedGryphon	ben_m: ah, so the difference is, defsketch actually does defapplet under the hood
2013-11-28 13:20:08	ben_m	Which seems to be the same thing
2013-11-28 13:20:12	CookedGryphon	in fact it seems to be an exact alias
2013-11-28 13:20:12	justin_smith	now a reddit style karma system for libs
2013-11-28 13:20:13	ben_m	Yeah.
2013-11-28 13:20:21	ben_m	I'm currently investigating source too.
2013-11-28 13:20:22	justin_smith	where each user could upvote / downvote a lib

2013-11-28 13:21:19	justin_smith	but then of course we would see "karma whore" libs, that include kitten pics and in jokes to get pushed to the top
2013-11-28 13:21:22	CookedGryphon	I use none when embedding some graphics in another bigger ui

2013-11-28 14:41:29	justin_smith	right
2013-11-28 14:41:42	justin_smith	thus my snark about propriety and windows :)
2013-11-28 14:41:50	drguildo	but maybe there could be some kind of workaround implemented in emacs's delete-process
2013-11-28 14:42:11	drguildo	but i don't know enough about windows system programming to have any ideas
2013-11-28 14:42:27	justin_smith	but the point of the jvm is to smooth over such things, so why not rely on the jvm (by telling it nicely to exit) rather than the os (by depending on shutdown behaviors specific to sane operating systems)
2013-11-28 14:42:28	drguildo	i've looked around and there are no obvious/easy ways of find a processes children
2013-11-28 14:42:43	drguildo	true
2013-11-28 14:43:12	WWWest1	hi all
2013-11-28 14:43:16	justin_smith	I mean if everyone had a sane OS, we wouldn't need the jvm now would we
2013-11-28 14:43:37	drguildo	it could also be seen as a problem in java.exe because it should really be killing it's child when it gets the signal to exit
2013-11-28 14:43:42	dsrx	does the jvm run on templeos?
2013-11-28 14:43:48	justin_smith	LOLOL
2013-11-28 14:43:50	WWWest1	is there something special to do to get :advanced compilation working when targeting node?

2013-11-28 14:48:33	francis_wolke	It's rather annoying that all library sources are stored in .jar files, as this prevents me from r-grepping the libraries that I use - is there an solution to this I'm simply oblivious to? There __are__ solutions, ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1342894/find-a-class-somewhere-inside-dozens-of-jar-files ) but I'm asking anyway because it seems likely that someone has had this issue before and solved it.

2013-12-02 10:41:14	ddellacosta	noprompt: yah, I'm just bitter 'cause I'm neck-deep in something which requires me to solve a lot of problems based on previous iterations which were not-so-well thought-out in some places.  Also, CoffeeScript

2013-12-03 10:30:26	jph-	im looking at @(http/get "http://http-kit.org" {:keepalive 30000}) as an example
2013-12-03 10:30:44	sritchie	it's a dereference;
2013-12-03 10:30:52	sritchie	http-kit returns a future,
2013-12-03 10:31:07	sritchie	and if you want to block and wait for its value you can use @<thecommand>
2013-12-03 10:31:21	jph-	ahh
2013-12-03 10:31:23	sritchie	it expands out to (deref <thecommand>)
2013-12-03 10:31:32	sritchie	if you want to poke at some docs
2013-12-03 10:31:32	jph-	so @ will block, without it it, it'll return something to go back to
2013-12-03 10:31:38	jph-	like a socket i can query
2013-12-03 10:31:56	jph-	sorry if im using wrong terminology

2013-12-03 10:34:09	sritchie	atoms, for example -
2013-12-03 10:34:17	jph-	thanks for pointing me in right direction
2013-12-03 10:34:17	sritchie	an atom is a mutable reference to an immutable thing
2013-12-03 10:34:18	sritchie	for sure
2013-12-03 10:34:28	sritchie	so when you call @some-atom,
2013-12-03 10:34:33	sritchie	you're peeking at the current value
2013-12-03 10:34:36	sritchie	inside the atom, by dereferencing the atomic reference

2013-12-03 10:35:14	sm0ke	is that correct statement? "an atom is a mutable reference to an immutable thing"
2013-12-03 10:35:32	sritchie	or is that a var :)

2013-12-03 10:35:58	SegFaultAX	No, it isn't correct.
2013-12-03 10:36:15	SegFaultAX	Because it implies something about the value, but an atom can also refer to a mutable thing.
2013-12-03 10:36:31	sritchie	I thought that clojure's atoms need to contain immutable things, since with the STM implementation calls to swap! can retry

2013-12-03 10:37:50	sm0ke	"An atom is just a mutable reference" is the converse true?

2013-12-03 10:38:00	sritchie	yup, agreed
2013-12-03 10:38:03	sm0ke	is every mutable reference ana atom?
2013-12-03 10:38:03	SegFaultAX	It's clearly unsafe to have a) side-effecting mutations or b) mutable state when using atoms or refs.

2013-12-03 10:39:14	SegFaultAX	sm0ke: Vars are interesting in that they have a root binding and a thread local binding, and those can be different things at different times.
2013-12-03 10:39:14	magnars	glosoli: are you referencing a resource in your css that you don't have?

2013-12-03 14:46:38	ambrosebs	mdrogalis: Like composing music say. If you haven't got any good ideas, the last thing you should (probably) be doing is writing :)

2013-12-27 19:06:29	[1]brian	does it just take the variable name, turn it into a keyword and take the value in the map?
2013-12-27 19:07:32	justin_smith	[1]brian: pretty much, but remember it is not a variable, it is a symbol
2013-12-27 19:07:48	justin_smith	a var is a specific thing, often when we use a symbol it is not pointing at a var
2013-12-27 19:08:15	justin_smith	a symbol even works as an implicit map lookup

2013-12-27 19:12:38	justin_smith	so more to the point of your original question, :keys is just a shortcut, you can do a more flexible destructuring (as you see in my above destructuring example, I hope)

2013-12-27 19:13:52	justin_smith	the quoting ensures that we can see the metadata on the var for the second

2013-12-27 19:19:54	justin_smith	Glenjamin: have you checked that the version of ring you are using has that function? try looking in the jar and seeing what is actually defined in there / the actual version

2013-12-27 19:29:37	[1]brian	so, both var and symbols can have values, but while a var is mutable, a symbol value is not, it can only be overshadowed by another scope, an unquoted symbol looks up either a symbol value or var value of the same name, a quoted symbol is a literal that can be used to only resolve var value by prefixing it with # or can be used as a key for maps

2013-12-27 19:42:28	jjttjj	yeah that's where I'm at now
2013-12-27 19:42:39	Glenjamin	but once you have a skeleton, try writing a test before implementing any helper function
2013-12-27 19:42:45	justin_smith	but then again state makes everything harder
2013-12-27 19:42:54	Glenjamin	or if you're extracting a helper function, write the tests before you do so

2013-12-27 19:44:43	Glenjamin	testing remote http calls can be tricky (but doable), i'd start with testing the helper functions
2013-12-27 19:44:44	justin_smith	can I create a var in a local binding, or vars by definition only attached to namespaces?

2013-12-27 23:09:38	bbloom	in short, having a single state tree is non tenable b/c you then need to have some sort of zipper that operates on that tree
2013-12-27 23:09:41	<--	HolyJak1 has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2013-12-27 23:09:41	bbloom	which is the cursor thing
2013-12-27 23:09:54	bbloom	then those cursor things become both "modified" trees but also are values from the past
2013-12-27 23:10:34	bbloom	if the cursor itself offers the ability to "dereference" it, then you have to bake in a pointer to the current root, or an indirection through a mutable root

2013-12-27 23:11:07	scottr	bbloom: I... followed none of that. Why do you need a pointer to root?

2013-12-27 23:11:45	bbloom	scottr: you'll see that MapCursor and VectorCursor both have value/state/path triples
2013-12-27 23:12:11	bbloom	the value is the map or vector, the state is the root of the tree, and the path is the location of the current map or vector in the root tree

2013-12-27 23:12:43	scottr	bbloom: AH. I wasn't really sure how value and state differed, but I needed so much state shared between my components that I just ended up passing the whole tree around...
2013-12-27 23:13:08	bbloom	in effect, a cursor is a zipper. there are two types of zippers: 1) this kind, where you record the traversal path and 2) the huet kind where you invert pointers to be relative to the "current" spot

2013-12-27 23:13:54	bbloom	yeah, that's what it looks like
2013-12-27 23:14:12	bbloom	the problem with the zipper approach is that you have multiple "components" and each component wants to think about the world concurrently. when you have concurrent zippers, you need to worry about isolation

2013-12-27 23:19:20	bbloom	scottr: in short, a zipper represents a tree viewed from a position other than the root

2013-12-27 23:19:47	scottr	bbloom: I don't think this addresses the original problem though, unless I'm just not seeing it.
2013-12-27 23:20:00	bbloom	scottr: like i said, there are two types: 1) huet zippers = interior node + pointers going out. 2) kiselyov zaippers = root + path

2013-12-28 18:59:35	Raynes	The motivation for switching back to Emacs is mostly because it is annoying to use Vim for everything *but* Haskell.

2013-12-28 19:14:48	Raynes	Lisp's indentation 'rules' are aesthetic. Haskell has significant whitespace and frequently 15 different ways to indent the same expression, some of which could make it mean different things.

2013-12-28 19:41:07	scottj	well, if that were less common couldn't you use metadata to escape the #js?
2013-12-28 19:41:24	Bronsa	jonasen: tools.analyzer.jvm's macroexpand-1 macroexpands Integer/MAX_VALUE in (.- Integer MAX_VALUE) for example, so that we only need to handle the host "." form and not the foo/bar form

2013-12-29 11:12:03	magnars	Ayey_: where str/ is clojure.string/
2013-12-29 11:12:16	ivan	why do protocol methods in clojurescript start with a -?
2013-12-29 11:12:58	magnars	Ayey_: the reason to use with-open and line-seq is to run over the file contents without "holding onto the head", to avoid keeping the entire file in memory.

2013-12-29 11:14:27	Ayey_	Ahh, thank you guys for all the soultions
2013-12-29 11:14:27	shock_one	Hi, guys. I'm trying to get a bunch of GET requests asynchronously using http-kit, but execution stops before all the callbacks are called. Is there a way to wait until all of them are finished? Here's the code (the commented out chunk work well, but is too slow) https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f18480ccb99b90abe30a
2013-12-29 11:16:15	magnars	shock_one: sounds like the poster child example for clojure.core.async

2013-12-29 11:17:18	amalloy	magnars, shock_one: that -main has no effect at all, aside from creating an unrealized lazy sequence. http-kit is already async, there's no pressing need to introduce core.async

2013-12-29 11:17:18	ivan	somewhere in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enwIIGzhahw I saw an example of core.async + httpkit

2013-12-29 11:17:52	amalloy	shock_one: (dorun (map ...)) would probably do all the work, although i'm not sure of http-kit's details

2013-12-29 11:20:26	magnars	amalloy: you say http-kit is already async, but isn't the idea behind core.async to help you work effectively with async code?
2013-12-29 11:21:50	amalloy	magnars: i mean, yes, but currently he's at the "working at all" stage, not "working effectively". there is no place in that code where core.async would make anything easier
2013-12-29 11:21:50	magnars	thanks for clarifying :)
2013-12-29 11:22:50	shock_one	amalloy: nope, doesn't work. The thing is that dorun finishes execution sooner than any of the requests get a chance to be finished. Are you familiar with node.js? This http-kit callbacks look exactly like node's except that node automatically tracks callbacks and doesn't exit the process before the callbacks counter is 0.

2014-01-18 12:18:05	koreth_	Not sure it's bragging (in all cases), just describing reality. The fact is that there *are* large code bases, so you want to look for tools that can handle them. Whether the large code base is a good or a bad thing doesn't matter.

2014-01-18 12:19:00	dnolen	koreth_: I think I can go out on limb and say Clojure was designed specifically to be anti-large codebase from the ground up.
2014-01-18 12:19:16	koreth_	I actually think that's going to be a big use case for Clojure. Build a little DSL and give it to your designers or finance people.
2014-01-18 12:19:46	koreth_	I know one company that tried to migrate to Scala and it fell flat because their designers couldn't handle the complexity.

2014-01-18 12:21:07	bbloom	lvh: you don't have to (read: probably shouldn't) write a new grammar to get a new DSL
2014-01-18 12:21:09	koreth_	Of course, you can build DSLs in anything, but in Clojure they aren't a separate thing, they're just Clojure code that uses your custom macros.
2014-01-18 12:21:29	koreth_	So your debugger and such can treat them as first-class language constructs.
2014-01-18 12:21:38	bbloom	in fact, you should do syntax LAST & work backwards from the minimal expression as data, since 99% of the the time you need a UI of some sort for non-programmer domain-experts to work with

2014-01-18 12:25:24	dnolen	kzar: an array yes, but you need to give each child a React key if you do.

2014-01-18 13:31:23	bitemyapp	there's a lot of surface area and lot of Haskell seems to be shining through nicely, especially typeclasses.
2014-01-18 13:31:33	bbloom	kristof: in particular, i'm talking about how they dismissed their current program-as-data approach b/c it relies on an interpreter & they wanted the benefit of ghc's quality implementation
2014-01-18 13:32:01	bbloom	kristof: i think that writing an interpreter is the "obvious" and sensible solution. the complaint i have is that nothing out there makes it all that pleasant to make that fast

2014-01-18 13:32:22	bbloom	we have great general purpose programming languages, but our meta programming tools are, frankly, utter shit still

2014-01-18 13:32:50	kristof	I would not call Lisp's metaprogramming "shit", but I consider homoiconicity and metaprogramming to be a relatively unexplored realm.

2014-01-18 13:32:59	bbloom	I think it's particularly unnatural to encode the dataflow in to a monad or applicative

2014-01-18 13:33:11	kristof	well ok :P
2014-01-18 13:33:25	bbloom	because those force pipelining in a way that is against the grain of the nature of the problem
2014-01-18 13:33:44	kristof	But yes, I think the proper word to describe metaprogramming is "naive"; Lisp metaprogramming essentially reduces down to complex manipulation of lists. Which is useful, but you can do more to describe code than "lisp"
2014-01-18 13:34:01	kristof	bbloom: Incorrect. They allow pipelining in a situation where it was wanted but previously unattainable.

We would have to use cljx and modify the emitters to product a sequence of strings, and quoted function calls that are returned by a macro.  Then we can just reduce across the sequence and pass the data in.

2014-01-22 20:54:09	djcoin	I'm relatively new to clojure but is there some way to intercept mutation to a datastructure (any kind) to be able to replicate those change later (rather than saving each time the new structure, I want to know the diff to apply it client side and to serialize it). Is there a lib somewhere which already does that ? I guess it may not be so hard to implement maybe cumbersome. Also if it worked with

2014-01-22 20:56:42	teslanick	You can use clojure.zip to walk through the object and find changes.

2014-01-22 23:01:47	ztellman	mookerji: interval-metrics requires an external driver for the aggregating and emitting

2014-01-22 23:04:48	mookerji	ah, ok. that makes sense.
2014-01-22 23:04:54	ztellman	but since there's more machinery to drive the aggregation, it might be slightly slower if you compare narrator's query-seq versus the bare interval-metrics aggregators

2014-01-23 21:49:01	stuartsierra	Supposedly on 64-bit architectures the difference between long and int is nonexistant.
2014-01-23 21:49:24	stuartsierra	It is very, very difficult to prove or disprove this in benchmarks.
2014-01-23 21:49:35	gfredericks	well it's gotta be somewhat existent to correctly preserve overflow :)

2014-01-23 21:50:15	stuartsierra	gfredericks: Good point.
2014-01-23 21:50:33	gfredericks	some of the bytecodes require converting to an int and then back to a long; I guess the 64-bit jvms notice that's happening and just keep everything long

2014-01-23 22:24:28	logic_prog	however, I did have to change my project.clj to use "core.async/core.async" rather than "org.clojure/core.async"
2014-01-23 22:24:35	technomancy	AeroNotix: yeah, we've been discussing creating a LEIN_VERBOSE env flag or something

2014-01-23 22:24:46	logic_prog	for some reason "lein install" (from the git clone github/core.async) ends up creating "core.async/core.async" rather than "org.clojure/core.async"

2014-01-23 22:25:26	tbaldridge	and no, we don't use lein to build
2014-01-23 22:25:28	AeroNotix	technomancy: I'd be happy. for Makefiles/CI it's good to silence stuff except stdout (providing people don't write errors to stdout and use return codes properly)

2014-01-23 22:26:38	Anderkent	logic_prog: so the fix you want to do is change the artifact name in asyncs project.clj to org.clojure/core.async
2014-01-23 22:26:48	Anderkent	then lein install will do what it shoud

2014-01-23 22:54:22	Anderkent	not before the ns form is evaluated, I think?
2014-01-23 22:54:41	Anderkent	I guess I care about the file, not the namespace
