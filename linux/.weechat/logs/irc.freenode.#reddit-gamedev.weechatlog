2013-12-09 13:30:13	_BRYAN	and they freaked out

2013-12-09 13:31:12	MrBushido	our government have been pretty good about education in recent years (though the conservatives are trying to screw that up atm)
2013-12-09 13:31:17	+Spacew00t	it's probably better over there, but America has a wider distribution of poor and wealthy areas
2013-12-09 13:31:26	_BRYAN	so instead of fighting these people to help them
2013-12-09 13:31:32	_BRYAN	I just say fuck it and go along with it

2013-12-09 13:34:42	_BRYAN	I dunno what they meant actually
2013-12-09 13:34:49	_BRYAN	they just said "you're the maintainer"

2013-12-09 14:11:23	_BRYAN	most fps view models for example only include what the player will see
2013-12-09 14:11:25	MrBushido	no though for animation purposes a single mesh can be beneficial especially at joints
2013-12-09 14:11:27	_BRYAN	the otherside isn't really there
2013-12-09 14:11:41	soundlus	so no difference at all? if something is all connected one continous mesh vs, multiple shapes just stuck next to each other?
2013-12-09 14:12:04	_BRYAN	whats your implementation

2013-12-09 14:12:41	MrBushido	soundlus: i think the main benefit is that it's easier to calculate smooth normals across a single mesh, where as having two separate meshes loses the continuity and thus can lead to artifacts

2013-12-09 14:13:04	soundlus	hmm that makes sense
2013-12-09 14:13:27	_BRYAN	the verticies should be connected
2013-12-09 14:13:54	_BRYAN	or different faces should share verticies

2013-12-09 14:14:29	x00000000	there's no absolute requirement, you can have 2 spheres completely unconnected to each other exported as a single mesh
2013-12-09 14:16:45	MrBushido	hmm, i forgot about that being true. what's the correct term for a contiguous set of vertices?
2013-12-09 14:17:41	MrBushido	surface?
2013-12-09 14:18:25	soundlus	hmm
2013-12-09 14:18:28	x00000000	I'm not sure of the precise definitions
2013-12-09 14:18:53	x00000000	but a closed surface is usually better for animation for example
2013-12-09 14:18:53	soundlus	I need to learn more about what is needed from models/textures within engines

2013-12-09 14:18:59	_BRYAN	a mesh doesn't have to be solid by any means, unless an implementation requires it
2013-12-09 14:19:09	MrBushido	soundlus: best way to learn is to experiment! become an art scientist!
2013-12-09 14:19:19	x00000000	ah yeah, solid works.
2013-12-09 14:19:25	_BRYAN	for example half-life level formats required world geometry to be isolated and sealed and every face solid and 3d
2013-12-09 14:19:50	soundlus	im just going to find a sucke...programmer to guide me with unity or something
2013-12-09 14:19:50	_BRYAN	concerning world faces, static meshes or player characters aren't bound by this rule though

2013-12-09 16:23:31	+Spacew00t	other than Name, Description, Author, and Version (internal to the game), is there any other information you think would be useful to know about a pack?
2013-12-09 16:23:36	+Spacew00t	maybe a website/email?
2013-12-09 16:24:59	+vraid	pack?
2013-12-09 16:25:04	+Spacew00t	oh sorry
2013-12-09 16:25:09	+Spacew00t	mod pack, for a game
2013-12-09 16:25:23	+Spacew00t	that adds new content like parts, sounds, and probably logic in the future

2013-12-09 16:25:45	+Spacew00t	is that important though? shouldn't that be in the mod title?
2013-12-09 16:25:47	+Spacew00t	I guess maybe not

2013-12-09 16:36:28	MrBushido	i mean i guess i can come up with some tests to do it, but that would be quite complicated to just checking png's magic number :D
2013-12-09 16:37:02	MrBushido	i guess one good test would be that the file length after the header matche the values at the width/height offsets
2013-12-09 16:37:02	+Jonas__	try to parse the header: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA#Header
2013-12-09 16:37:23	+Jonas__	you could disprove tga but never prove it, that way
2013-12-09 16:37:31	+Jonas__	but that goes for any binary file of any format I suppose
2013-12-09 16:37:46	MrBushido	Jonas__: yeah, but that's not super helpful in the sense that so long as the file is 18bytes long you have a megusta valid header :D
2013-12-09 16:38:59	MrBushido	i guess i'll just make sure it's one of the last file formats to be checked by my image class
2013-12-09 16:39:02	+Jonas__	well, if you can extract as many pixels as the header specifies too, sure
2013-12-09 16:39:22	+Jonas__	maybe just pretend there is no tga
2013-12-09 16:39:22	MrBushido	yeah, it would be unlikely that that would be identical for two different formats
2013-12-09 16:39:31	MrBushido	but i just wondered if there was a foolproof check
2013-12-09 16:41:46	ophui	MrBushido, http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html does it, might check its source

2013-12-18 15:35:19	BaconOfKnowledge	So I'll have to work at home on muh game
2013-12-18 15:35:59	BaconOfKnowledge	I was wondering what to do game design wise for hit collision on my FPS
2013-12-18 15:36:01	BaconOfKnowledge	Like
2013-12-18 15:36:08	BaconOfKnowledge	a guy shoot a bullet to another guy
2013-12-18 15:36:17	BaconOfKnowledge	is it the first that decide to inflict damage or the guy that receives the bullet
2013-12-18 15:36:44	BaconOfKnowledge	I wonder how quake 3 does it
2013-12-18 15:38:22	t7	(when directions are unit vectors) distance to intersect = dot(plane origin - ray origin, plane normal) / dot(ray normal, plane normal)
2013-12-18 15:38:23	+urraka	or none of them
2013-12-18 15:38:32	t7	is that right guiz :3
2013-12-18 15:40:19	+urraka	my bullet calls a callback on collision, which either the Client or Server listens to
2013-12-18 15:40:43	BaconOfKnowledge	urraka: plot twist : there is no servers
2013-12-18 15:40:44	+urraka	the Server inflicts damage on the player who got shot
2013-12-18 15:41:00	+urraka	well then your game/state whatever
2013-12-18 15:41:19	+urraka	without networking it can only get easier :p
2013-12-18 15:41:27	BaconOfKnowledge	The choice is between "He got shot" / "I got shot"

2013-12-18 15:42:05	BaconOfKnowledge	urraka: there is networking
2013-12-18 15:42:16	+urraka	well in my opinion it should be done by something external
2013-12-18 15:42:21	BaconOfKnowledge	Just the host cannot manage game logic
2013-12-18 15:43:16	+urraka	what does the host do then :p
2013-12-18 15:43:24	BaconOfKnowledge	I'm using photon
2013-12-18 15:43:41	BaconOfKnowledge	The host just forward messages between clients, but doesn't compute anything itself
2013-12-18 15:43:43	+urraka	ah
2013-12-18 15:44:05	BaconOfKnowledge	Or I could make a dedicated server using it
2013-12-18 15:44:06	BaconOfKnowledge	Hmmmm
2013-12-18 15:44:19	+urraka	so your problem is actually whether to decide on one peer or the other

2013-12-18 15:44:27	zebbiz_phone	Yo
2013-12-18 15:44:27	BaconOfKnowledge	urraka: yeah that
2013-12-18 15:44:53	BaconOfKnowledge	If the guy who shoot applies the damage, it will appear fairer to him and lag won't have any effect
2013-12-18 15:45:03	icetooth	are there any p2p games out, no server?
2013-12-18 15:45:04	BaconOfKnowledge	But the guy who get hit may wonder where the damages come from
2013-12-18 15:45:41	BaconOfKnowledge	The other way would make that the guy who shoots may not inflict damage even thought the bullet is straight on his opponent on the screen
2013-12-18 15:45:41	abeck99	best way is client calcs it (shooter) and the server does a rough veritifcation and replicates it to other clients
2013-12-18 15:45:57	+urraka	yeah but he has no server
2013-12-18 15:46:05	abeck99	that way the client shooter gets immediate feedback, and the server can make sure its not a hack
2013-12-18 15:46:05	BaconOfKnowledge	From what I remember, Counter Strike does it shoot site
2013-12-18 15:46:05	BaconOfKnowledge	side
2013-12-18 15:46:45	+urraka	either way is bad so you might make it so the one who shoots decides
2013-12-18 15:47:00	abeck99	oh, ive not seen this ever in p2p type games, i think you can just replace "server validates" with all the other clients do a rough validation
2013-12-18 15:47:02	+urraka	so it feels like shooting works
2013-12-18 15:47:08	abeck99	just to ensure its not a hack or anything
2013-12-18 15:47:18	BaconOfKnowledge	yeah that's what I thought urakka
2013-12-18 15:47:25	BaconOfKnowledge	At least that's what I would expect as a player
2013-12-18 15:47:27	abeck99	you need immediate feedback on the client though, unless you have perfect ping
2013-12-18 15:48:01	+urraka	getting random damage might not feel as bad as being unable to damage other players
2013-12-18 15:48:02	BaconOfKnowledge	+ it solves the problem of who killed a player, since the shooter can put his ID on the target

2013-12-18 15:51:26	abeck99	just in general p2p is very difficult to have an agreed on game state
2013-12-18 15:51:45	abeck99	without marking one peer as the authoerity (IE the server)

2013-12-18 15:53:41	abeck99	this is an illustration of how difficult it is - if lag is bad enough the other clients should validate the shot, but what happens on failed validation? how does that get repped back around
2013-12-18 15:54:53	zebbiz_phone	Would be nice with a network game with torrent protocol
2013-12-18 15:54:56	icetooth	would it be best to group peers into local pools that agree on sub states, and then closest members between pools agree on the game state as a whole and sync,  or just have a free for all between peers?

2013-12-22 11:40:31	+jorgenpt	Slow shader compilers are the worst.
2013-12-22 11:40:34	+jorgenpt	LOOKING AT YOU AMD.
2013-12-22 11:42:27	+Amadiro	I'd happily wait a little longer if the result is better optimized...
2013-12-22 11:43:12	+GTHaxor	fuck my klout went down to 50
2013-12-22 11:43:29	+GTHaxor	time to twitter more
2013-12-22 11:43:59	+jorgenpt	Amadiro: That's the funny part though, NVIDIA's compiler gives better results in my experience.
2013-12-22 11:44:29	+Amadiro	jorgenpt, aye, AMD seems to have a lot of parts in their drivers they just didn't arse to optimize
2013-12-22 11:44:40	+jorgenpt	Amadiro: But it's mostly ridiculous that they don't do any caching, so *every* time you link the shader it's slow.
2013-12-22 11:44:44	+Amadiro	but I'm cool with that particular part, since I'd compile all my program objects at load-time anyway
2013-12-22 11:45:05	+jorgenpt	Well, yes, but: Steam Big Picture spends ~8s every startup on my AMD Mac Pro, just compiling & linking shaders.
2013-12-22 11:45:25	+Amadiro	woah, how many shaders do they have?!
2013-12-22 11:45:25	+Amadiro	65535?
2013-12-22 11:45:25	+jorgenpt	About ~650.
2013-12-22 11:45:45	+jorgenpt	really just permutations of like 6 shaders or something, with different flags #defined.
2013-12-22 11:45:59	+Amadiro	Sure it's the compilation/linkage that causes the slowdown?
2013-12-22 11:46:00	+jorgenpt	That's not really cool. So now I have to find hacks to speed it up.
2013-12-22 11:46:05	+jorgenpt	Right
2013-12-22 11:46:40	+Amadiro	12.3ms per shader is a lot
2013-12-22 11:46:58	+jorgenpt	Uh huh.
2013-12-22 11:47:39	+jorgenpt	I don't know if their compiler on other platforms is any better.
2013-12-22 11:49:17	+Amadiro	I did a quick instrumentation, and get around 22us for the vertex part, 7.1us for the fragment part, and 241us for the linking
2013-12-22 11:49:31	+Amadiro	average blinn-phong
2013-12-22 11:49:55	+jorgenpt	Obviously it depends on the shader :-)

2013-12-22 11:54:54	+jorgenpt	I also wonder how much of the slowness is just due to the GLSL driver architecture on Mac.
2013-12-22 11:55:04	MrBushido	doesn't nvidia have that already? a bunch of defines that you can use to activate certain behaviours
2013-12-22 11:55:04	+jorgenpt	Since it seems to be pretty slow on NVIDIA too.
2013-12-22 11:55:09	+Amadiro	cool, there actually is a "#pragma optionNV(strict on)"

2013-12-27 18:00:49	+timeshifter	this is probably a good thing to deal with though, seeing as the water will be dynamic

2013-12-28 13:10:02	+Spacew00t	on the scroll wheel of your mouse
2013-12-28 13:10:14	+Amadiro	...down?
2013-12-28 13:10:19	+Spacew00t	okay just making sure
2013-12-28 13:10:34	+Amadiro	on apple systems it'd be up by default.

2013-12-28 13:12:08	+Spacew00t	makes more sense to have it inverted when using touchpads
2013-12-28 13:12:20	+Spacew00t	makes moving between trackpad, mouse, and windows difficult though
2013-12-28 13:13:25	+Spacew00t	then again, it's a touchpad, not a touchscreen
2013-12-28 13:13:34	+Spacew00t	natural mapping gets totally fucked when you confuse the two

2013-12-28 13:23:48	+Spacew00t	Dunno if it's dyslexia or poor design sense, but I ALWAYS seem to reverse scroll bars in every possible way
2013-12-28 13:24:23	+Spacew00t	everything from putting the scroll bar on the left side of a panel, to placing the up button at the bottom of the scroll bar...

2013-12-28 13:26:27	+Amadiro	Spacew00t, I think left-right confusion is a thing in medicine/neurology
2013-12-28 13:26:41	+Amadiro	so get tested, I suppose :P
2013-12-28 13:27:16	+Spacew00t	I know I was tested multiple times from childhood to adulthood, but I'm not sure if I ever tested positive for dyslexia
2013-12-28 13:27:29	+Spacew00t	pretty sure they said "ur brain so weird deez tests don't work"

2013-12-28 13:30:05	+Spacew00t	I should look at the results again, but I think they skirted around any definite diagnosis, only that "he needs extra time on tests and a bunch of other shit"

2013-12-28 16:17:42	OmegaVesko	If I make any money in the near future the first thing I'm buying is NGUI

2013-12-28 16:23:08	+Spacew00t	Bread != GUI system
2013-12-28 16:23:18	Shammah	investment wise it's maybe great, but it's still expensive realtive to what it offers
2013-12-28 16:23:23	Shammah	*relative
2013-12-28 16:23:29	+Spacew00t	A GUI System is more like a breadmaker, assuming making bread saves you more time then going to the store and buying it

2013-12-28 16:24:17	+Spacew00t	3 meta 5 me
2013-12-28 16:24:21	OmegaVesko	You could probably do most things NGUI can do in Unity's GUI system, it would just take 10 times longer
2013-12-28 16:24:30	OmegaVesko	You just have to ask yourself if your time is worth that
2013-12-28 16:24:34	+GTHaxor	OmegaVesko that's the dumbest thing I"ve ever heard
2013-12-28 16:24:43	+Spacew00t	it remains to be seen if these systems even work well for pixel perfect crap
2013-12-28 16:24:48	+GTHaxor	Of fucking course you can do most things in NGUI. You would just have to rewrite NGUI
2013-12-28 16:24:56	Shammah	I'm not doubting the use of NGUI, just saying a hundred bucks is expensive
2013-12-28 16:25:00	Shammah	sudden;y i'm the fucking devil
2013-12-28 16:25:12	+GTHaxor	no shammah, you were always teh devil

2013-12-28 16:25:27	Shammah	that wasn't the point
2013-12-28 16:25:31	OmegaVesko	It's just more justifiable if you're planning to make money on the product
2013-12-28 16:25:32	+Spacew00t	GTHaxor probably

2013-12-28 16:33:14	Shammah	it's like you know instantly you know something's on the Unreal Engine, you also know instantly when something is on Unity and uses its GUI
2013-12-28 16:33:31	+GTHaxor	the only thing worth using from above and beyond software is their sprite manager 2
2013-12-28 16:33:41	+GTHaxor	but that was a long time ago. NGUI is probably more useful now
2013-12-28 16:34:03	OmegaVesko	Is Sprite Manager similar to 2D Toolkit?
2013-12-28 16:34:09	+GTHaxor	similar but worse
2013-12-28 16:34:13	OmegaVesko	Yeah, thought so
2013-12-28 16:34:22	+GTHaxor	I'd say 2dtk is #1 in that category
2013-12-28 16:34:29	OmegaVesko	Oh yeah, definitely
2013-12-28 16:34:37	OmegaVesko	Thankfully the built-in 2D tools are pretty decent
2013-12-28 16:34:39	+GTHaxor	different from NGUI, of course
2013-12-28 16:37:07	OmegaVesko	Why the fuck doesn't the Asset Store have a 'top free' section apart from the shitty sidebar on the front page
2013-12-28 16:38:33	+Amadiro	IMO unity is as much of a middleware platform as a game engine, so don't expect the packages for advanced functionality that come for free with the engine to be too stellar :D

2013-12-28 17:09:57	Waynes1	or C#
2013-12-28 17:09:58	Kelet	Yeah, it has to be manually added, or at least exceed some popularity threshold
2013-12-28 17:10:01	abeck99	i think thats an association
2013-12-28 17:10:16	abeck99	yeah, google has some word assocaiations, so it searches like words (I think its manual)

2013-12-28 20:16:34	DrAwesomeClaws	RRR2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvA1O7MYs_w  it's actually basically this as opposed to traditional OO inheritance
2013-12-28 20:16:44	Waynes	maybe both at once
2013-12-28 20:17:03	zebbiz_phone	Hot
2013-12-28 20:17:15	DrAwesomeClaws	in that case, instead of having the gameobject inherit from a base class providing color change functionality, you just attach a component to the game object which changes the color of arbitrary objects
2013-12-28 20:17:27	RRR2	wait what
2013-12-28 20:18:05	RRR2	so basically
2013-12-28 20:18:21	RRR2	you add a method to some object that not changes object color but other objects colors?
2013-12-28 20:18:44	DrAwesomeClaws	no, i mean that the color change script doesn't care which object it is attached to
2013-12-28 20:18:56	-->	blackwhite has joined #reddit-gamedev
2013-12-28 20:19:30	DrAwesomeClaws	it can be attached to any gameobject and (assuming in this case that the object has a renderer attached) that object will be able to have its color changed

2013-12-28 20:22:24	UnicornForest	RRR2: it's the difference between "is a" and "has a" in traditional OO based game dev you end up with these long inheritance chains like object->renderedobject->controlableobject->player  where player is a controlableobject and so forth down the line, in an component system you would have a player which "has a" render, controler, ect

2013-12-28 20:26:08	MrBushido	sometimes it might make sense to make playerentity be the renderable object, since there's a lot of potentially shared information in there such as position, boundbox info etc, however it also makes sense to completely separate them in to two distinct is a/has a type objects

2013-12-28 20:44:23	+Amadiro	DrAwesomeClaws, using goto is a fairly standard way in C to do error handling

2013-12-28 20:44:56	+Amadiro	DrAwesomeClaws, that's just so that the block never executes unless you goto to it

2013-12-28 20:51:05	k00pa	in some cases they are fine
2013-12-28 20:51:05	+Amadiro	and then I put the if and the unbracketed body on the same line
2013-12-28 20:51:12	k00pa	but its easy to use them the wrong way
2013-12-28 20:51:31	+Amadiro	well, it's easy to accidentially mess them up, particularly when someone else starts modifying your codebase

2013-12-28 21:37:50	+Amadiro	slime, nice, but I'm not sure I agree with all the stuff he writes about SIMD -- SSE has a lot of instructions that specifically rely on the vectors being in AOS rather than SOA form (like dotproduct) and using that explicitly can give you speedups (assuming you're processing large enough quantities of it, and using properly aligned memory)
2013-12-28 21:38:02	+Amadiro	cache is not an issue in that case, since the dot product will touch all the components each time anyway...
2013-12-28 21:38:46	+slime	Amadiro: erm, doesn't he basically say that?
2013-12-28 21:39:06	+Amadiro	slime, nah, he wants it the other way around
2013-12-28 21:39:13	+slime	oh, misread you
2013-12-28 21:39:27	+Amadiro	the way he does it is better for his AABB test, but will render things like dotproduct slow/useless
2013-12-28 21:39:35	+slime	he gives an example of using the dot product with SOA
2013-12-28 21:39:39	+slime	without shuffling
2013-12-28 21:40:19	+Amadiro	slime, hm, where?
2013-12-28 21:40:28	+slime	"Organizing the data so its SIMD-friendly means using a struct-of-arrays (SOA) layout rather than the array-of-structs (AOS) layout that Ive been calling naive SIMD. In other words, instead of making a hardware vector register hold the xyzw components of a geometric vector, you make it hold the x-components of four different vectors. Another register holds four y-components, another holds four z-components, etc. This has vari
2013-12-28 21:40:28	+slime	ous advantages:" [...] "You generally have much less shuffling to do. For instance, doing a dot product of two geometric vectors doesnt require any shuffling. If the rest of your application doesnt use SOA layout, youll have to do some shuffling to get data in and out of SOA on entry and exit of the optimized-SIMD parts. However, you can often keep internal buffers in SOA layout throughout their lifetime."
2013-12-28 21:40:41	+slime	below the aabb benchmark
2013-12-28 21:40:58	+slime	i mean, he gives that as an example of using SOA without shuffling
2013-12-28 21:41:26	+Amadiro	I don't see how that can work?
2013-12-28 21:41:42	Eynx	Use SOA everywhere else, doesn't require shuffling
2013-12-28 21:42:09	Eynx	If the data is already organized into SOA before executing the dot product, it doesn't require any shuffling

2013-12-28 22:20:54	Eynx	MrBushido, that was the problem but I fixed that
2013-12-28 22:20:58	Eynx	now it just isn't rendering
2013-12-28 22:21:04	Ryxuma	you using openGL?

2013-12-28 22:21:16	Ryxuma	ah can't help then
2013-12-28 22:21:29	MrBushido	Eynx: you tried applying a solid colour shader to the geometry to make sure it is?

2013-12-28 22:21:42	Eynx	MrBushido, yes, that's the current shader it's using
2013-12-28 22:22:10	MrBushido	have you considered using opengl instead?
2013-12-28 22:22:16	MrBushido	:D
2013-12-28 22:22:24	Ryxuma	i agree with this
2013-12-28 22:22:25	Eynx	I don't like working with OpenGL
2013-12-28 22:22:30	MrBushido	it really is the smart choice
2013-12-28 22:22:34	Eynx	>smart choice
2013-12-28 22:22:45	k00pa	d3d api seems a lot clearer than opengl
2013-12-28 22:22:56	+Amadiro	k00pa, they both have their idiosyncracies
2013-12-28 22:23:03	k00pa	also, from what I have heard the d3d api provides much more control over the hardware
2013-12-28 22:23:13	+Amadiro	both provide fairly little control over the hardware :P
2013-12-28 22:23:16	MrBushido	your program will work with windows/mac/linux and depending on what version/profile you use can easily be ported to ES for tablets and such
2013-12-28 22:23:21	Ryxuma	openGL is open source which is a plus
2013-12-28 22:23:24	Eynx	ew, mobile
2013-12-28 22:23:26	k00pa	something, something, pointer to texture
2013-12-28 22:23:26	Eynx	fuk dat
2013-12-28 22:23:38	Ryxuma	also webGL
2013-12-28 22:23:39	Eynx	I don't really care about *nix operating systems right now either
2013-12-28 22:23:54	k00pa	just let the guy use what he has chosen
2013-12-28 22:24:03	MrBushido	Eynx: just so you know, i wont buy your game then
2013-12-28 22:24:05	k00pa	d3d is more popular choice anyway in commercial games
2013-12-28 22:24:07	+Amadiro	k00pa, both D3D and GL have pathes to give you client-managed memory (like the map_buffer_range extension with the UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT flag set)
2013-12-28 22:24:13	Eynx	MrBushido, implying my game has a price on it
2013-12-28 22:24:19	+Amadiro	but it's not the "standard way of doing things"
2013-12-28 22:24:30	Eynx	I'm not making a game right now anyway
2013-12-28 22:24:33	Eynx	I'm making an engine
2013-12-28 22:24:47	k00pa	Amadiro: haven't used neither of those extensively so I can't comment. one of my friend has just said a lot of shit about opengl
2013-12-28 22:24:51	MrBushido	Eynx: all the things you learn from creating games in directx may eventually be applied to a title which does have a price
2013-12-28 22:24:51	k00pa	~~
2013-12-28 22:24:53	Ryxuma	you though of a groovy name for it yet?

2013-12-28 22:24:59	MrBushido	i wont buy your game :P
2013-12-28 22:25:07	k00pa	I would assume that he is correct on those, but I am not going to forward that more before I have witnessed it myself
2013-12-28 22:25:09	Eynx	MrBushido, implying I don't want to make my games free
2013-12-28 22:25:12	MrBushido	even if its awesome, i will not buy your game
2013-12-28 22:25:18	MrBushido	i will not play your game either
2013-12-28 22:25:20	+Amadiro	k00pa, well, they are really both very "high-level" and give you little control over the hardware compared to gcn, xbox d3d9 and mantle
2013-12-28 22:25:24	+Amadiro	which may or may not be for the better
2013-12-28 22:25:26	Eynx	I'm okay with that

2013-12-28 22:25:36	Ryxuma	Eynx make an openGL port of it, a whole extra customer!
2013-12-28 22:25:41	MrBushido	RobStorm: i can't tk, so i wont play your game!
2013-12-28 22:25:51	Eynx	Plus I'm doing this mostly as a learning experience
2013-12-28 22:25:51	Randomized	Opengl is a medium level binding with low level syntax

2013-12-28 22:26:26	Eynx	OpenGL's extensions
2013-12-28 22:26:26	MrBushido	but as somebody that just switched to linux, it's really bugging me how many games don't have linux support
2013-12-28 22:26:28	k00pa	well the syntax, thats one thing for sure
2013-12-28 22:26:39	Eynx	GLSL is worthy committing suicide over as well
2013-12-28 22:26:46	Ryxuma	i'm with you there
2013-12-28 22:26:47	MrBushido	i bet none of them actually use any functionality that isn't provided by a crossplatform library
2013-12-28 22:26:48	k00pa	MrBushido: something like 6 years ago I used linux for 2 years
2013-12-28 22:26:52	+Amadiro	you get used to the syntax, and there are bindings that C++-ify it, if you're into that kind of thing
2013-12-28 22:26:53	k00pa	played tf2 on emulator
2013-12-28 22:26:54	k00pa	and shit
2013-12-28 22:26:56	Ryxuma	everything is prefixed with gl
2013-12-28 22:27:00	k00pa	that was horrible times D:
2013-12-28 22:27:05	+Amadiro	GLSL is better and cleaner than about anything else, IMO
2013-12-28 22:27:15	k00pa	then I just fucking gave up and I run windows on main machine
2013-12-28 22:27:18	k00pa	linux on servers
2013-12-28 22:27:21	Ryxuma	k00pa why did you switch to linux?
2013-12-28 22:27:23	k00pa	I would like to have linux on main desktop, but meh
2013-12-28 22:27:34	+Amadiro	glloadgen can generate you bindings that look like gl::TexImage2D if you want to, then you can get rid of the gl:: prefix entirely
2013-12-28 22:27:35	k00pa	Ryxuma: well I never really "switched". My first "own" computer was linux
2013-12-28 22:27:48	+urraka	sounds like he just wants to commit suicide
2013-12-28 22:27:55	MrBushido	if glFunc bloat annoys you, use glloadgen instead of glew

2013-12-28 22:28:26	Ryxuma	k00pa: The only reason
2013-12-28 22:28:26	k00pa	that forced me to focus more on the coding side
2013-12-28 22:28:32	k00pa	yeh, the only reason. games
2013-12-28 22:28:42	k00pa	and at this point, I like visual studio a lot
2013-12-28 22:28:49	k00pa	the debugger is awesome <3
2013-12-28 22:28:56	Ryxuma	yeah it is
2013-12-28 22:28:58	MrBushido	generate the pointer_cpp version and everything gets put in a gl namespace, so gl::Begin() etc :D

2013-12-28 22:33:07	Eynx	OpenGL extensions make me want to commit suicide
2013-12-28 22:33:09	Eynx	and so does GLSL
2013-12-28 22:33:20	+Amadiro	There are many cool GL extensions
2013-12-28 22:33:23	+slime	Eynx: why? the extensions expose very useful things
2013-12-28 22:33:31	+slime	often taking advantage of certain hardware
2013-12-28 22:33:33	+Amadiro	and glloadgen & co makes it easy and pleasant to check for existence and load them
2013-12-28 22:33:38	Eynx	slime, I prefer having a single compiler for everything, as is the case with D3D
2013-12-28 22:33:47	+slime	certain vendors do the same thing for DX, but they have to do it in a much more hacky way, no?
2013-12-28 22:33:51	MrBushido	Eynx: then just use the core profile
2013-12-28 22:34:00	MrBushido	nobody is forcing you to use extensions
2013-12-28 22:34:00	+Amadiro	Eynx, er, I think you misunderstand what an extension is
2013-12-28 22:34:04	+slime	Eynx: you don't have to use extensions, and what does the compiler have to do with it?
2013-12-28 22:34:06	Eynx	MrBushido, I'm not using them
2013-12-28 22:34:08	+Amadiro	it doesn't switch out your compiler.
2013-12-28 22:34:16	+Amadiro	an extension is something that gives you additional functionality
2013-12-28 22:34:21	Eynx	I'm using the headers provided by the official site
2013-12-28 22:34:25	Eynx	and just going from that
2013-12-28 22:34:39	MrBushido	use glloadgen, it only exposes what you need
2013-12-28 22:34:43	Eynx	Not even using wgl because I get symbol errors with it
2013-12-28 22:34:58	+zhov	why do people use directx when opengl exists and is cross-platform? legit curious

2013-12-28 22:35:51	MrBushido	Ryxuma: no, no, no
2013-12-28 22:35:55	+Amadiro	Ryxuma, GL is the industry standard, D3D is not a standard
2013-12-28 22:36:01	Ryxuma	really?
2013-12-28 22:36:02	+mflux	http://www.twitch.tv/sentiient/ fencing tournament in blade symphony
2013-12-28 22:36:23	+Amadiro	Ryxuma, yes. And graphics card are neither modelled after D3D or GL (both are pretty "mismatched" to the actual hardware)
2013-12-28 22:36:27	Eynx	slime, I get symbol errors for trying to use most gl functions with the unofficial libraries
2013-12-28 22:36:33	+slime	Eynx: you use the *GetProcAddress functions or you use something like glLoadGen which handles it all for you
2013-12-28 22:36:36	+zhov	i just can't imagine shooting yourself in the foot from the get-go with not supporting multiple platforms
2013-12-28 22:36:36	Eynx	and with the official library, I get symbol errors for wgl functions
2013-12-28 22:36:44	Eynx	or well, the ARB and EXT functions give symbol errors
2013-12-28 22:36:50	MrBushido	Ryxuma: directx and opengl are exactly the same thing give or take a few differences. both are an interface language between the driver and the application
2013-12-28 22:36:52	+slime	Eynx: sounds like you don't understand C/C++ then? :P
2013-12-28 22:36:57	Ryxuma	Well I'm an idiot then
2013-12-28 22:37:04	Eynx	slime, hah, insult my intellect because of a few errors I'm getting

2013-12-28 22:37:05	+Amadiro	zhov, traditionally windows just completely dominated on the desktop, so being cross-platform wasn't even a consideration
2013-12-28 22:37:20	+Amadiro	zhov, only recently has linux gained the market majority by taking the mobile space
2013-12-28 22:37:32	+Amadiro	and only recently has the mobile space become interesting for game-makers
2013-12-28 22:37:33	+zhov	Amadiro: yeah i remember. i guess i forgot how slow companies are to consider anything new
2013-12-28 22:37:42	+slime	Eynx: i'm being serious, it sounds like you have a problem created by your own use of the code and aren't understanding what the compiler is telling you
2013-12-28 22:37:45	+Amadiro	The majority of games made now is probably in GL/GLES, if you count mobile
2013-12-28 22:37:48	k00pa	lol
2013-12-28 22:37:51	Eynx	slime, no
2013-12-28 22:37:54	k00pa	opengl awr
2013-12-28 22:37:55	Ryxuma	ha I swear I read somewhere that most GPU's were optimised for D3D
2013-12-28 22:37:55	k00pa	nobs
2013-12-28 22:38:02	Eynx	I compiled my own libraries, symbol errors
2013-12-28 22:38:09	Eynx	Linked my own functions and extensions, symbol errors
2013-12-28 22:38:20	Eynx	etc etc symbol errors

2013-12-28 22:38:46	+Amadiro	Ryxuma, for a while GL was the faster API, because D3D did not allow for efficient frontend optimization by the GPU manufacturer
2013-12-28 22:38:50	MrBushido	Ryxuma: perhaps at microsoft/directx.com :D
2013-12-28 22:38:53	Eynx	slime, do whatever you want

2013-12-28 22:40:53	MrBushido	odds are drivers use the same code for both directx and opengl
2013-12-28 22:40:59	+Amadiro	MrBushido, think about them more like a remote server you're doing RPC to, I think that fits the model better...
2013-12-28 22:41:06	jeffz	mib_232323: is it a web game?
2013-12-28 22:41:22	+slime	MrBushido: GPUs still have a lot of fixed-function hardware (which ends up being more efficient than if you were to "emulate" it with the programmable pipeline)
2013-12-28 22:41:25	k00pa	mib_232323: does it work?
2013-12-28 22:41:26	mib_232323	no its an downloadable game
2013-12-28 22:41:35	mib_232323	its an online fps
2013-12-28 22:41:37	jeffz	mib_232323: is ita virus? you don't even have a proper nick or irc client
2013-12-28 22:41:38	MrBushido	yeah, i've used that analogy too, but that's not what a gpu is so much, as that's what a graphics api is like opengl/directx
2013-12-28 22:41:42	mib_232323	we have 2 peple online
2013-12-28 22:41:48	jeffz	mib_232323: learn to irc.
2013-12-28 22:42:08	+Amadiro	MrBushido, and if you want, you can think of the driver as being another man in the middle in your connection, who adds some lag and some processing overhead between you and the final RPC server
2013-12-28 22:42:09	k00pa	woah woah
2013-12-28 22:42:16	mib_232323	yeah it works

2013-12-29 11:06:12	Entalyan	Hmm, 4.1 isn't that great :S Before I just looked it up I thought they had finally gotten around to being up-to-date, because I still thought they were on 2.3
2013-12-29 11:06:12	Entalyan	But apparently the rest of the world is on 4.4
2013-12-29 11:08:12	Entalyan	Too bad, 4.3 and 4.4 have features I think would benefit Mac users.
2013-12-29 11:09:12	abeck99	i think adoption for 4 is generally still far behind, iirc most open stastics about that had opengl usage at less than 10% of people who play games
2013-12-29 11:10:00	-->	MisterSpeaker has joined #reddit-gamedev
2013-12-29 11:10:00	abeck99	its so confusing to know what opengl version to target though, since you dont want to make a confusing scenario for players as well
2013-12-29 11:10:00	Entalyan	Yeah, that's why I was asking about it
2013-12-29 11:11:04	Entalyan	I thought Windows just came with a decent version of OpenGL, and linux users can choose their own version.
2013-12-29 11:11:15	abeck99	i think on windows it's the card manufacters who distribute them with drivers
2013-12-29 11:11:15	abeck99	but on osx its apples implementation

2013-12-29 11:12:03	Entalyan	So basically, on linux and windows you're always on 4.4 now. Maybe some linux distro's a *bit* behind, but can't be far.
2013-12-29 11:12:58	abeck99	nah, if you have a modern card you're on 4.4
2013-12-29 11:12:58	Entalyan	Nvidia above the 400 series.
2013-12-29 11:13:15	abeck99	like i said its still ~less than 10% of people who can run opengl4+
2013-12-29 11:13:15	Entalyan	Oh, no AMD... Strange
2013-12-29 11:13:48	Entalyan	Hmm, I suppose you might havea point
2013-12-29 11:14:15	abeck99	i dunno, there are people here on IRC who are way more knowledgable about this than me
2013-12-29 11:14:27	abeck99	someone posted a bunch of usage stats that are public
2013-12-29 11:14:27	Entalyan	Well, not 4.4 I guess. 4.3 should run on AMD and Nvidia cards starting from AMD HD5000 and Nvidia 400 series

2013-12-29 11:18:19	Entalyan	For rendering (which seems like an OSX type of task) I'ld be pissed at not having 4.4 on OSX. I think all Macs ship with, and have for the past few years, nvidia 400+ cards. Modern ones have 600 series I think.
2013-12-29 11:18:25	Entalyan	And I'ld demand this feature (4.3): Compute shaders leveraging GPU parallelism within the context of the graphics pipeline
2013-12-29 11:18:27	Entalyan	Ah well

2013-12-29 11:24:51	Entalyan	The others have Intel then?
2013-12-29 11:24:55	jeffz	yes, the latest Intel HD does opengl 4 though iirc
2013-12-29 11:25:51	Entalyan	I didn't really count Macbooks though. Laptops are laptops, even though they look pretty, they still perform like laptops.

2013-12-29 11:28:57	Entalyan	All the doomsayers (or prophets, depending on whose side you're on) are saying gaming will move away from Windows. That's fine by me, but I would prefer to see it move towards Macs than towards Linux.

2013-12-29 11:32:36	_bryan	why
2013-12-29 11:32:36	Entalyan	Unless the next generation of Intel chips is A) significantly faster and B) ALL have VT-d enabled, because if both those things happen I'll just game in a VM
2013-12-29 11:33:56	Entalyan	Because I don't like linux as a daily use desktop OS. I *love* it for servers, and hobbyprojects. But I feel the user experience of the various desktops available is just not up to scratch with both Windows and Apple
2013-12-29 11:34:56	_bryan	for a game which is going to run in a canvas of it's respective API who gives a fuck about the user experience of the operating system
2013-12-29 11:34:56	_bryan	it's just as technically viable to do anything windows and directx does in regard to graphics
2013-12-29 11:35:56	Entalyan	Yes it is
2013-12-29 11:35:56	_bryan	if you don't like it for games, then don't play games on it which at this stage is quite easy to accomplish

2013-12-29 11:36:56	_bryan	but I run steam with big picture and the games avaliable on it perfectly fine
2013-12-29 11:36:57	Entalyan	_bryan: My point is the opposite. I do like it for games, but I DON'T like it as a desktop OS. So I'm saying that I hope gaming stays on Windows, or moves to Mac.
2013-12-29 11:37:11	Entalyan	And I don't like dualbooting too much
2013-12-29 11:37:56	_bryan	I hope gaming gets the fuck off windows
2013-12-29 11:37:56	Entalyan	FIne by me, as long as it doesn't go to linux ;)
2013-12-29 11:38:01	_bryan	I don't understand why you would think that based on you not wanting it as a desktop os
2013-12-29 11:38:56	_bryan	even in the end you could use the direct framebuffer
2013-12-29 11:38:56	_bryan	xorg and those things are also infintely more flexible than what windows provides to it's developers
2013-12-29 11:38:56	_bryan	through bloat and bullshit
2013-12-29 11:38:56	Entalyan	I don't think I understand what you mean.
2013-12-29 11:39:56	Entalyan	Flexible is exactly the problem: It breaks every 2,5 months :p
2013-12-29 11:39:56	_bryan	windows is a bloated platform
2013-12-29 11:39:56	_bryan	given that a lot of things support cross platform
2013-12-29 11:40:34	_bryan	there is no inhereit negative in supporting linux as a platform
2013-12-29 11:40:34	_bryan	other than bringing more attention to it to make it more accesible to a wide market
2013-12-29 11:40:58	_bryan	linux works perfectly fine as a desktop environment, of which I prefer
2013-12-29 11:41:58	_bryan	saying that you hope it stays on platform it's only because of marketing and politics
2013-12-29 11:41:58	_bryan	is fucking stupid
2013-12-29 11:41:58	_bryan	only on*
2013-12-29 11:41:58	_bryan	don't like your desktop on linux? get a different environment.

2013-12-29 11:47:32	Entalyan	_bryan: I prefer Linux to stay the way it is. A bit broken, but always with the latest and greatest in efficiency. Always with the cool innovative UI stuff, even though you can usually tell the designers up at Apple and MS (ignoring Win8, that UI is just silly) are just 1 step ahead of the linux guys.
2013-12-29 11:48:27	Entalyan	I can't claim to have worked with ALL desktop UI's though, so if you have one to reccomend that is really good, I'ld love to try it
2013-12-29 11:48:55	_bryan	I don't know what's broken about it, but I don't know each environment has their own thing
2013-12-29 11:48:55	Entalyan	Unity, KDE, Gnome and Xfce I've already tried.

2013-12-29 11:49:46	_bryan	lxde which is like xfce but even lighter weight with bare basic features
2013-12-29 11:50:30	Entalyan	_bryan: Broken as in, the video card drivers I needed were not compatible with Xorg, so I had to downgrade 1 version. Which caused Unity to make a fuss, because it wasn't compatible, so I had to downgrade that too.
2013-12-29 11:50:30	_bryan	or you could just use the openbox windows manager
2013-12-29 11:50:31	_bryan	what video card do you have
2013-12-29 11:50:38	Entalyan	legacy radeon
2013-12-29 11:51:56	Entalyan	4870x2. But that was just an example. I can think of more.
2013-12-29 11:51:56	_bryan	a 4 series?
2013-12-29 11:52:57	_bryan	I'm using a gtx 460 right now which is working perfectly fine

2013-12-29 12:03:29	UnicornForest	k00pa: you would want virtual desktops if you used them and they worked well (unlike the 3rd party apps)
2013-12-29 12:03:29	Entalyan	UnicornForest: That exactly what I meant before. They're far ahead. But I feel it's often not 100% polished. For instance getting linux to properly display fonts can be a pain. And I personally just feel that some features seem to be missing, or hidden, or stuff like that. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm just saying I feel the 2 proprietary (desktop) OS's are a step ahead in UI consistency
2013-12-29 12:03:29	Entalyan	and polish
2013-12-29 12:04:20	k00pa	UnicornForest: I have used kde3/kde4/wmii extensively on my home and work machines

2013-12-29 12:04:29	Entalyan	But I also said, that that is EXACTLY the reason why I *love* linux. Just not for every day :p

2013-12-29 12:05:29	k00pa	and yeah, UI consitency is something linux fails badly

2014-01-15 12:26:26	MrBushido	yeah, i have no idea which is best, but i wanted to try tiling and xmonad was haskell
2014-01-15 12:26:31	MrBushido	and i dont want to catch the haskell :D
2014-01-15 12:26:47	t7	xmonad is sweet
2014-01-15 12:26:57	MrBushido	so i went with the first one i found that was written in a mans language
2014-01-15 12:26:58	t7	but it needs the haskell platform installed (big)
2014-01-15 12:27:10	t7	so unless u use haskell that might be an issue
2014-01-15 12:27:36	t7	MrBushido: isnt it written mostly in lua?
2014-01-15 12:27:42	MrBushido	also bash's completion mysteriously broke when i was playing around getting it working
