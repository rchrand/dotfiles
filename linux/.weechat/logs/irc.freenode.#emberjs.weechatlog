2013-11-11 17:34:14	SinisterMinister	I think I may need to implement unknownProperty and proxy everything through it. After the object. The object is instantiated in the model method on the route. It returns an RSVP promise
2013-11-11 17:34:25	SinisterMinister	the promise returns the ORM object on resolve

2013-11-11 18:27:50	SinisterMinister	locks: yeah, it's built around the idea of using repositories as the DAL, so you can swap them out with other persistent stores (mysql, mongo, etc). One of the things the repository will do is provide a schema that the ORM uses to build its models
2013-11-11 18:28:08	SinisterMinister	The mysql repo uses introspection to build the schema based on the tables in your database
2013-11-11 18:28:24	endash	knownasilya: createWithMixins
2013-11-11 18:28:25	SinisterMinister	so if you have a `users` table, you could just call ORM.factory('user') and have a user model to work with
2013-11-11 18:28:31	locks	sounds interesting and complicated :P

2013-11-11 18:29:17	SinisterMinister	thanks

But the ticket itself looses the comment array before it is send to server. Here is jsfiddle with the save method: http://jsfiddle.net/imazined/EchJ4/ - I use Ember-Data-3. Can anybody tell, what I'm doing wrong?
2013-11-12 14:46:05	imazined	Ah and it runs inside the ticket controller, so the use can add a comment directly to the ticket

This likely happened because your server returned data in response to a find or update that had a different id than the one you sent.
2013-11-12 17:28:02	commadelimited	After the update is saved server side, what needs to be returned from the server so that Ember toddles along as it should?

2013-11-12 17:28:21	erundook	commadelimited, obviously you have to add the id field to your interaction

2013-11-12 17:29:03	-->	cowboyd has joined #emberjs
2013-11-12 17:29:04	erundook	or better interaction = this.store.findById(...); interaction.field = 'new_value'; interaction.save()

2013-11-12 17:30:21	commadelimited	Do I need to bother with this.store.update()? Or can I just make the change, and save it?
2013-11-12 17:30:22	erundook	oh. maybe your backend doesn't return an id?

2013-11-12 17:30:54	commadelimited	No, the server is literally returning the string "twitter-tweet-400268293673467904-10001262"
2013-11-12 17:30:55	-->	pose has joined #emberjs
2013-11-12 17:31:10	erundook	oh. it should return an object instead
2013-11-12 17:31:22	erundook	either object or 204 no content
2013-11-12 17:32:50	erundook	returning an object is useful for situations where something goes wrong, so frontend can sync the object state back to the state that it has at backend
2013-11-12 17:33:13	commadelimited	Excellent.
2013-11-12 17:33:23	commadelimited	So I'll just return the original record. Thank you erundook.
2013-11-12 17:33:31	erundook	no problem
2013-11-12 17:33:31	commadelimited	The docs aren't helpful in that respect.
2013-11-12 17:33:54	erundook	well returning a string doesn't comply to REST

2013-11-12 18:11:53	TMQuinn	so I'm trying this

2013-11-12 18:12:01	knownasilya	or doing it on the server if that's all you do with the data
2013-11-12 18:12:09	TMQuinn	but this is returning null
2013-11-12 18:12:26	TMQuinn	I think because the promise hasn't resolved before the filter is applied
2013-11-12 18:12:34	knownasilya	because a find returns a promise.. do find(..).then(function (resolvedModel) {...});

In my model1Add flow I set the model1 attribute (string) and I also try and assign model2 values (through a multiple select). Before the save I can see the model2 values set on model1 array, however the server receives an empty model2 array.

2013-11-12 22:25:35	dericabel	So I am trying to build an emberjs timeout component, it's main purpose is to warn the user they are idle and give then a chance to stay logged in or if they don't acknowledged the prompt it will log them out anyway

2013-11-14 17:53:47	shterrett	I'm trying to set a placeholder value for a dropdown in the 'didInsertElement' event of a View. The placeholder I want is a value on the current model. However, the didInsertElement apparently fires before the model's promise is fulfilled, and so the model's attributes are all undefined. Is there a way to make the rendering of the view or the didInsertElement callback wait for the model to be fully loaded?
2013-11-14 17:54:24	-->	jpoz has joined #emberjs
2013-11-14 17:55:25	sly7_7	perhaps you could just define an observer on the model's promise and set the placeholder when it's fullfilled ?

2013-11-14 18:02:00	tzellman	hi everybody! looking for best practice on alternative to extractMeta (in the RESTSerializer) - it appears to be gone in the master/canary
2013-11-14 18:02:06	sly7_7	shterrett, not sure I understand but if the model is a promise object, I think you could be able to do something like modelDidResolved: function() { if model.get('isFullfilled') { this.set('placeholder') model.get('value')}}.observes('model.isFullfilled')

2013-11-14 19:55:51	gauthierm	shterrett: I'm just working on the same thing (observing controller property). I think it should work as controller.property without the model. The controller is a proxy for the controller.model.

2013-11-14 19:56:52	shterrett	gauthierm: right. I think when I tried before, I was observing a method on the controller. This way, it's observing the attribute directly and seems to be firing properly.

But now I want to connect it with a simple API and use latest ember-data beta3 for it. I'm using active model serializers on the rails end.

2013-11-14 21:47:25	alexspeller	tzellman: you're welcome, it was a useful thing to implement
2013-11-14 21:47:40	alexspeller	as in, it was useful for me to figure out how the router works
2013-11-14 21:48:02	Dafe	Anybody know offhand how the link-to helper determines what to put in the dynamic segments?
2013-11-14 21:48:12	webguy024	thanks alexspeller didn't think about tackling it that way.
2013-11-14 21:48:34	tzellman	I'm using the each helper for an arraycontroller, have the itemController set properly, but yet the item passed as an argument to my action method (inside the each) is not the controller for the item, but rather the item
2013-11-14 21:49:03	alexspeller	alex88: the default target of an action is the controller
2013-11-14 21:49:12	alexspeller	alex88: this means that by default it won't hit the view at all
2013-11-14 21:49:17	tzellman	so it makes it difficult to change application state
2013-11-14 21:49:18	tzellman	for the item
2013-11-14 21:49:31	alexspeller	Dafe: how do you mean?
2013-11-14 21:49:41	Dafe	I have some nested routes, and when I only specify the terminal model, I'm getting undefined in my link-to URLs.
2013-11-14 21:49:56	Dafe	For the parent routes.
2013-11-14 21:49:59	alexspeller	Dafe: it should use the current value for those routes
2013-11-14 21:50:14	alex88	alexspeller: ok, that's strange, because the ember web dev toolbar in chrome shows the correct view, template and controller for that div, but clicking on the button doesn't fire the action on the controller
2013-11-14 21:50:16	Dafe	But it doesn't. :(
2013-11-14 21:50:47	alexspeller	the fact that you get undefined not an error suggests that it is using the current value
2013-11-14 21:51:03	alexspeller	however it doesn't sound like it's being serialized correctly
2013-11-14 21:51:21	alexspeller	you should ensure that the serialize method on your route is handling it properley

2013-11-14 22:13:59	robyurkowski	i think a big part of that learning curve is ember-data, though
2013-11-14 22:14:05	robyurkowski	just ember itself isn't too difficult to learn
2013-11-14 22:14:30	robyurkowski	ember with ember-data takes a long time, because what ember-data does isn't always apparent, and it doesn't always seem consistent or predictable

2013-11-14 22:15:05	joachimhs	robyurkowski: Definitely. The fact that Ember.js expects the API to be implemented as an identity map in order to gain maximum performance, is something most developers will never have encountered before

2013-11-14 22:37:54	Dafe	So what I think would be better is just have a repo with a commit per logical step, so it's easy to just look at a diff while you talk about it, and show what it does, and you can go back to any point in the timeline if someone has questions, etc.

2013-11-14 22:38:23	joachimhs	Dafe: That's a good approach, but it does take away some of the process of live coding
2013-11-14 22:38:45	Criten	I do it per feature or sub-feature for the most part
2013-11-14 22:38:56	Criten	well... depending what it is
2013-11-14 22:39:06	Criten	if it's a large feature do a featurebranch
2013-11-14 22:39:38	joachimhs	Dafe: I did most of the examples for the Ember Fest Training via live coding. Then when a lesson was completed, I pushed the code to GitHub and gave the attendees a few extra tasks to work on (while keeping in-subject)

2013-11-14 22:41:34	Dafe	I think it would just generally go smoother if you have the code working and you know it works ahead of time.
2013-11-14 22:41:50	Dafe	And being able to do a pull at any step, to me, would be huge.
2013-11-14 22:41:56	joachimhs	Dafe: Yeah, it needs to be WELL prepared for any live coding.. Because you cannot go "off script" in any reliable way during live coding :)
2013-11-14 22:42:16	Dafe	Like, for the audience.

2013-11-15 21:01:55	erundook	caught a weird issue. when creating a record to the store, server also sends notification via pusher, and if that push notification comes faster than POST request returns, i end up having two models with the same id in my store. wondering if there is a proper way to handle that

2013-11-15 21:55:06	cackle	I'm attempting to do something similar to http://redfin.com where moving the map updates the data shown as markers on the map and as a list underneath... Since the bounds of the map determine the "page" of data, I'm assuming I can't load the model in the router
2013-11-15 21:55:25	cackle	If that's the case, is it kosher to load the data in the controller itself?
2013-11-15 21:56:16	cackle	That is to say, initialize the map in the view, then grab the bounds, then set those on the controller and load the data

2013-11-15 21:57:59	cackle	I basically have to let the view render entirely before inserting data
2013-11-15 21:58:06	cackle	So I can't use, say, loading substates

2013-11-15 22:07:09	cackle	the problem is that i don't have the bounds until the map is loaded
2013-11-15 22:07:14	cackle	because it's based on the css width of the map
2013-11-15 22:07:26	cackle	if it was fixed width i could calculate them
2013-11-15 22:07:48	cackle	and then have event listeners that fire on changes to the bounds or resizes

2013-11-15 22:08:10	endash	i haven't drilled into query params yet… but I imagine you could simply adjust the route to add params for long and lat… if they're missing, do nothing, once they're set.. load the models
2013-11-15 22:08:21	endash	with the benefit of being shareable

2013-11-15 22:09:09	cackle	so, the way I think it'll work is that you'll transition into the map route
2013-11-15 22:09:15	cackle	and then it'll load the map and set the bounds
2013-11-15 22:09:21	endash	it might take the form of a redirect? /map -> /map?lon=5&lat=5
2013-11-15 22:09:22	cackle	and that'll bubble up to the query params
2013-11-15 22:09:25	cackle	^ yup
2013-11-15 22:09:39	cackle	something like that
2013-11-15 22:13:50	cackle	yea, looks like i can use the "idle" event in google maps to determine when the map is loaded and/or has been dragged and requires a transition
2013-11-15 22:13:58	erundook	endash, still fighting that race condition. don't think i can do anything useful on backend since i can't make it to send anything after request is served

2013-11-20 22:20:50	denisnazarov	mengu: you need it for data bindings
2013-11-20 22:20:53	samg_	the script tags are for binding. ember replaces the content between the script tags to update the dom when bindings change.
2013-11-20 22:20:58	<--	adambeynon has quit (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
2013-11-20 22:21:03	samg_	if you don't need binding, you can use {{unbound title}}
2013-11-20 22:21:06	mengu	i'd just pass arguments like {{link}} and i definitely don't need title there
2013-11-20 22:21:15	mengu	*script tags there, not title :)
2013-11-20 22:21:29	samg_	you need the script tags if you want the value to update when "link" changes

2013-11-24 17:11:06	MartinElvar	Is it possible to call a method within a if in handlebars?
2013-11-24 17:11:07	-->	vlad_starkov has joined #emberjs
2013-11-24 17:11:36	MartinElvar	like {{#if myMethod(1)}}
2013-11-24 17:11:36	MartinElvar	which doesn't seem to work
2013-11-24 17:12:10	endash	elis2013: both {{render}} and {{view}} instantiate a view… render also brings in a controller that the view uses as its context.. so its a way of porting around part of your application. view by itself is a way of bringing in particular functionality in a specific place
2013-11-24 17:12:10	endash	MartinElvar: no
2013-11-24 17:12:13	endash	if needs to point to a property
2013-11-24 17:13:00	elis2013	view is like an island part?
2013-11-24 17:13:05	MartinElvar	endash: so i am working on a wizard, instead of setting step = 1, i would have to create a property for each step? like step1 = true, step=false?
2013-11-24 17:13:18	elis2013	so how does it differs from components?
2013-11-24 17:13:37	MartinElvar	i need to check for current step, in order to render the correct markup
2013-11-24 17:13:48	endash	elis2013: typically when you use {{view}} you're instantiating a low level, generalized component… like a text field, or a date picker… and actually, in a lot of cases a component would do just as well or better in place of view
2013-11-24 17:14:10	elis2013	okay...
2013-11-24 17:14:12	elis2013	thanks

2013-11-24 17:14:38	elis2013	perhaps you can help with structuring?

2013-11-24 17:14:44	elis2013	i mentioned it briefly earlier
2013-11-24 17:15:10	elis2013	I basically have a list of projects
2013-11-24 17:15:10	elis2013	each project might have a list of datasets
2013-11-24 17:15:11	elis2013	and I want to display the current project (and it's datasets) in my sidebar
2013-11-24 17:15:25	elis2013	currently i'm trying to do it with a {{render "sidebar-projects"}}
2013-11-24 17:15:34	elis2013	and creating the relevant view + controller (array controller?)

2013-11-24 17:16:17	elis2013	but it seems like A) EAK is having trouble with dash-seperated names (my view and controller files are loaded but not seem to affect the sidebar)
2013-11-24 17:16:40	MartinElvar	endash: Appreciate it
2013-11-24 17:16:57	elis2013	and B) I need to get the data from the server, so I'm going to have to request from my store
2013-11-24 17:17:06	endash	elis2013: that's how I'd approach it… I don't use EAK though :/
2013-11-24 17:17:17	endash	as for data, what library are you using

2013-11-24 17:21:19	endash	elis2013: no prob

2013-11-24 17:31:05	endash	is let's say you wanted to do /events, and /events/:date

2013-11-24 17:34:42	MartinElvar	Can anyone btw. tell me what is preferred to use, route or resource?
2013-11-24 17:35:13	MartinElvar	Is there a difference at all?
2013-11-24 17:35:13	erundook	endash, i actually don't know the difference between plain routes and resource routes
2013-11-24 17:35:13	endash	it'd look like this.resource('passwordReset', function () { this.route('show', {path: '/:token'}) }
2013-11-24 17:35:30	endash	without a token it will go to PasswordIResetndexRoute, with a token it will got o PasswordRestShowRoute

2013-11-24 17:35:48	endash	but they share a common PasswordResetRoute, and a common parent PasswordReset template
2013-11-24 17:36:01	erundook	and the controller?
2013-11-24 17:36:04	MartinElvar	So in some cases, it can be useable as a fallback?
2013-11-24 17:36:29	endash	erundook: each route gets its own controller
2013-11-24 17:36:46	endash	MartinElvar: my rule of thumb, if you're describing a noun, it's a resource
2013-11-24 17:36:56	endash	so 'books' is a resource, 'edit' is a route
2013-11-24 17:37:09	erundook	endash, oh, i guess i can just do something like PasswordResetWithTokenController = PasswordResetController.extend
2013-11-24 17:37:11	endash	in some cases resource can be helpful to get around limitations in the router though
2013-11-24 17:37:53	MartinElvar	endash: Makes sense, thank you :)
2013-11-24 17:38:51	endash	erundook: you can also ignore the sub routes entirely...

2013-11-24 17:39:11	erundook	endash, i need controller actions for it as well
2013-11-24 17:39:29	elis2013	so I've created a specialized adapter
2013-11-24 17:39:49	elis2013	my question is: do I need to use the Seralizer as well, or can I work only with the adapter?
2013-11-24 17:39:54	endash	erundook: if you put everything in the main password reset template, it will be targeting your main password reset controller, not the controller for the route
2013-11-24 17:40:38	erundook	oh, right
2013-11-24 17:40:40	erundook	cool
2013-11-24 17:40:53	endash	the store is very much serializer aware so you'll probably need both

2013-11-24 17:43:06	elis2013	but I'm not sure what's the serializer's part in receiving data, or how to use it
2013-11-24 17:43:33	elis2013	documentation doesn't define exactly how to use it or why
2013-11-24 17:43:39	endash	it's the serializer's job to ensure the JSON received is in the correct format

2013-11-24 20:32:46	wilhearts	Hello everyone, how is it possible to access a passed variable inside a component definition ? as in {{ date-picker date=createdAt }}, how do i access the date var from App.DatePickerComponent = Em.Component.extend({}); ?
2013-11-24 20:33:22	bkparso	Have you tried this.get('date') ?
2013-11-24 20:33:36	wilhearts	yep, returns undefined :/
2013-11-24 20:33:56	bkparso	Inside the component definition, try putting date: null

2013-11-24 20:34:37	wilhearts	yes, createdAt is equal to new Date() on the model
2013-11-24 20:34:37	-->	yuters_ has joined #emberjs
2013-11-24 20:34:43	wilhearts	and it shows fine in the template

2013-11-24 20:36:06	-->	navo has joined #emberjs
2013-11-24 20:36:24	bkparso	I think there's something to setting the property up on the component itself. Otherwise it might be trying to access a property on the view or whatever the "model" equivalent is for a component
2013-11-24 20:38:11	wilhearts	@bkparso, this does not get me my date
2013-11-24 20:38:22	Dafe	wilhearts: Double check you have your scoping right.
2013-11-24 20:38:26	bkparso	Sorry.. thought it was worth a shot
2013-11-24 20:38:42	Dafe	Like, put {{createdAt}} directly before the component in your template.
2013-11-24 20:38:48	wilhearts	@bkparso, yeah, thanks alot for trying :)

2013-11-26 14:57:12	rels	endash: it's mandatory for me to load first time over http, then I work on local-storage. So when page is loaded, ajax isn't finished, when finished it populates a colleection
2013-11-26 14:57:19	rels	endash: should do it in beforeModel ?
2013-11-26 14:57:24	endash	if you override init you have to call this._super() too
2013-11-26 14:57:35	ankurk	Hey guys, just a quick question can I use "window.location" in Ember?
2013-11-26 14:57:43	<--	annlewis has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-11-26 14:57:44	endash	somewhere in the router

2013-11-26 14:58:46	rels	endash: addind the call to super works ! but you said that I shouldn't put that there, so where ? Somewhere in the router isn't very precise haha :p
2013-11-26 14:59:05	ankurk	I am actually sending an Ajax request to the server for PDF output, so I using, window.location("url") in the success callback
2013-11-26 14:59:27	endash	depends on what your app looks like… if you have /objectives i'd do it in the model hook of that route
2013-11-26 14:59:49	rels	yep I have
2013-11-26 15:00:07	endash	ankurk: ah to change to a whole new page? location is a setter

2013-11-26 15:00:21	elis2013	endash, regarding the promise on the application route -
2013-11-26 15:00:22	endash	not a function
2013-11-26 15:00:36	ankurk	so is there an Ember equivalent?
2013-11-26 15:00:38	elis2013	you just do "return session.save()" which returns a promise
2013-11-26 15:00:50	endash	ankurk: just do window.location = url;
2013-11-26 15:00:55	endash	elis2013: yep
2013-11-26 15:00:55	elis2013	but you are not verifying that the session has been saved

2013-11-26 15:01:05	endash	elis2013: the promise will reject
2013-11-26 15:01:07	elis2013	what happens if my promise is rejecting rather than resolving
2013-11-26 15:01:18	limptwiglet	do render helpers get access to the parent controller context
2013-11-26 15:01:20	rels	endash: like when extending my model adapter ?

2013-11-26 15:01:32	ankurk	endash: will follow this thanks! :)
2013-11-26 15:01:34	endash	then the error event fires
2013-11-26 15:01:53	elis2013	so how do you handle the correct path to transition to user to? and in what part of the app are you doing/checking that
2013-11-26 15:01:53	elis2013	?
2013-11-26 15:02:10	rels	(not using ember-data)

2013-11-26 15:02:47	endash	elis2013: i'd chain it onto the save()
2013-11-26 15:02:53	ankurk	endash: actually I was mistaken, I am using window.open("url"), so my question again, can I use it? I guess so I can use it. *and I need a coffee*
2013-11-26 15:03:07	endash	ankurk: yeah no reason why not

2013-11-26 15:04:00	elis2013	as in "session.save().then(resolveFunc, rejectFunc)"?
2013-11-26 15:04:17	elis2013	and in the resolve/reject funcs transition the user to the correct route?
2013-11-26 15:04:26	endash	yep
2013-11-26 15:04:27	elis2013	all of that in the application route, right?

2013-11-26 15:05:24	-->	coffeeofficer has joined #emberjs

2013-11-26 15:06:18	endash	because you handle your failure state
2013-11-26 15:06:24	endash	so you don't actually want the promise rejecting
2013-11-26 15:07:06	-->	gucki has joined #emberjs
2013-11-26 15:07:10	elis2013	so should I do something special inside my resolved/rejected funcs?
2013-11-26 15:07:17	endash	no
2013-11-26 15:07:30	endash	so two scenarios
2013-11-26 15:07:31	endash	valid session
2013-11-26 15:07:32	endash	invalid session
2013-11-26 15:07:45	-->	jasocox has joined #emberjs
2013-11-26 15:07:51	endash	return session.save() will resolve with a valid session, reject with an invalid session, triggering an error

2013-11-26 15:08:07	endash	return session.save().then(function () {} ) will resolve with a valid session, reject with an invalid session, triggering an error
2013-11-26 15:08:17	endash	return session.save().then(function () {} , function () {} ) will resolve with both
2013-11-26 15:08:39	endash	return session.save().then(function () {}, function (e) { throw e; }( will reject with an invalid session
2013-11-26 15:08:46	endash	you;re basically "catching the exception"
2013-11-26 15:09:00	endash	and handling the error yourself with the redirect
2013-11-26 15:09:24	endash	when you do the transitionTo() in the handler
2013-11-26 15:09:45	endash	that aborts the transition that is waiting on the promise in the first place

2013-11-26 15:12:50	limptwiglet	mmmm
2013-11-26 15:13:09	limptwiglet	but this needs to be rendered into multiple different controllers
2013-11-26 15:13:20	endash	what's the use case
2013-11-26 15:13:31	limptwiglet	i have a jsbin
2013-11-26 15:13:48	limptwiglet	endash: http://emberjs.jsbin.com/oNoKOcOh/1/edit
2013-11-26 15:14:10	limptwiglet	basically I would like to have the ability to drop a a render block in which would generate a search able list of models
2013-11-26 15:14:25	limptwiglet	a textfield for user input and the select will get populated with matches
2013-11-26 15:14:35	limptwiglet	(obviously the jsbin dosnt show filtering)
2013-11-26 15:14:57	limptwiglet	but how can this sub controller effect the parent controller?

2013-11-26 15:16:10	-->	hglattergotz has joined #emberjs
2013-11-26 15:17:08	endash	one way is the outer controller will be the target of the {{render}}ed controller
2013-11-26 15:17:16	endash	so actions will bubble up to it
2013-11-26 15:18:38	limptwiglet	endash: imagine that this is a form, and i need to associate something selected in this render block to the data containing the selection
2013-11-26 15:18:48	limptwiglet	ie a project with users assigned to it
2013-11-26 15:18:58	limptwiglet	i never thought to try actions
2013-11-26 15:19:44	limptwiglet	so i could have a observer on the render controller which would call send with the new selection
2013-11-26 15:19:53	limptwiglet	and then have an actions block in my parent that would capture that
2013-11-26 15:20:01	endash	typically you'd pass in the object you want the form to manipulate
2013-11-26 15:20:41	limptwiglet	but this list could be potentially 1000's of items long so i need a way to filter
2013-11-26 15:21:35	endash	ok i get you now
2013-11-26 15:21:49	endash	a poor man's autocomplete
2013-11-26 15:21:58	limptwiglet	sorry, english is my first language but you wouldnt be able to tell!
2013-11-26 15:22:19	limptwiglet	yeah i guess, how else could I do an autocomplete?
2013-11-26 15:22:26	limptwiglet	integrate select2?
2013-11-26 15:22:33	limptwiglet	and just hit an endpoint
2013-11-26 15:22:40	endash	and you want the same controller/form to work with multiple attributes

2013-11-26 15:22:56	endash	mmkay
2013-11-26 15:23:46	limptwiglet	i mean am i totally approaching this wrong, would it be better to just use a select2 style lib and then just squish it into ember
2013-11-26 15:24:12	limptwiglet	but that feels wrong to me as I would be circumventing the ember-data

2013-11-26 15:29:56	afoeder	these "elements" are form elements, consider them as kind of a partial
2013-11-26 15:30:17	endash	you could do {{render 'search_form' attribute="department"}} then in the search view attributeBinding: "controller.attribute"
2013-11-26 15:30:27	endash	^ limptwiglet

2013-12-02 10:54:10	basz	Is this correct? When a route exists with a dynamic segment, but the denamic segment was not on the url, the value is present on the params object as a string with value "undefined" with  SomeRoute = {model : function(params)... I would expect it have a value of undefined not "undefined".

2013-12-03 13:03:28	MartinElvar	Jdubs: and the binding maybe
2013-12-03 13:03:39	robyurkowski	miguelcobain: nope, no issues here
2013-12-03 13:03:48	robyurkowski	keep in mind it returns a promise, though
2013-12-03 13:03:58	Jdubs	Honestly I don't really understand bindings yet (new to ember, I've inherited this app)
2013-12-03 13:04:04	Jdubs	Which part would be the binding?
2013-12-03 13:04:19	MartinElvar	Jdubs: Your template should do
2013-12-03 13:04:24	Jdubs	kk
2013-12-03 13:04:26	miguelcobain	robyurkowski: So, I should replace the model in the promise?
2013-12-03 13:04:44	robyurkowski	miguelcobain: what are you trying to do with it?
2013-12-03 13:04:52	Jdubs	Whole template or just the {{each}} section?
2013-12-03 13:05:22	miguelcobain	I need to discard any changes made so far and reload the model entirely. rollback() will not do because it doesn't support rollback of hasMany relationships.

2013-12-03 13:07:41	Jdubs	if i leave the view and come back to it, they don't show up. It's just not refreshing dynamically
2013-12-03 13:08:34	miguelcobain	robyurkowski: What happens: I change a property from, say, 12 to 13. I do a model.reload() and in the promise, I get the model with the property set to 13.
2013-12-03 13:08:45	miguelcobain	I inspected the response from the server, and it sends that property as 12.

2013-12-03 13:12:56	robyurkowski	miguelcobain: i suspect it's applying the changes overtop the reloaded version
2013-12-03 13:13:06	Jdubs	so does that mean the controller is the parent controller as well?
2013-12-03 13:13:10	miguelcobain	If I do oldModel === promiseModel it returns true.

2013-12-03 13:14:14	MartinElvar	Jdubs: Alright, then how are referencing the object? When you delete it?
2013-12-03 13:14:18	robyurkowski	do a rollback before you reload
2013-12-03 13:14:38	Jdubs	let me see
2013-12-03 13:14:47	robyurkowski	but is the problem it's not rolling back if it's only got relationship changes?
2013-12-03 13:15:21	miguelcobain	robyurkowski: I would use rollback() if I could. The problem is Ember Data does not rollback hasMany relationships.
2013-12-03 13:15:29	Jdubs	this is from the route that is handling everything:
2013-12-03 13:15:47	Jdubs	dropStudent: (student) ->; student.deleteRecord(); student.save()
2013-12-03 13:15:53	Jdubs	semicolons to represent newlines
2013-12-03 13:16:04	miguelcobain	This is currently known and intentional. So, imagine I add some model to a hasMany relationship. Then do a rollback. The model stays there.

2013-12-03 17:14:20	mmun	do you know the id?

2013-12-03 17:14:29	elis2013	findBy looks like it

2013-12-03 17:14:36	mmun	store.find('dataset', id)

2013-12-03 17:15:13	webguy024	hello, I am using a form for both new and edit. When I rollback a new record I get a flash in the form that shows isNew is destroyed, before the transition happens. How can I do this better? -> http://jsfiddle.net/webguy/DVh25/1/
2013-12-03 17:15:44	piotrm	Is there a way for Router to redirect from _=_ to some propper #url ?
2013-12-03 17:15:51	webguy024	if you click on new company and then click on companies, you will see it flashes to "Edit" in the header.
2013-12-03 17:15:56	elis2013					var dataset = project.get('datasets').findBy('id', parts.datasetId);

2013-12-03 17:18:32	danlucraft	elis2013: double check id is not a string value
2013-12-03 17:21:09	elis2013	the thing is
2013-12-03 17:21:16	elis2013	I get the datasets as part of the project
2013-12-03 17:21:30	elis2013	so doing store.find('dataset', id) is not the best solution for me
2013-12-03 17:21:34	elis2013	as I already have the datasets

2013-12-03 17:28:52	danlucraft	and you’re sure that you have the project model, and that project.get(“datasets”) gives you what you expect?

2013-12-03 17:29:21	elis2013	what I am sure of is that when rendering in the template
2013-12-03 17:29:38	elis2013	I traverse the project, it's datasets, and each dataset tables, and it all renders fine
2013-12-03 17:29:55	elis2013	so I assume that it's working, I mean the store and fetching of the objects
2013-12-03 17:30:01	danlucraft	ok, so what’s in the “project” in your code snippet above?
