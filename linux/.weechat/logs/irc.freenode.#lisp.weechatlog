2013-11-10 14:55:10	fredmorcos	can a macro be recursive?

2013-11-10 14:56:12	beach	fredmorcos: Sure.  The most common way is that its expansion contains another call to the same macro.

2013-11-10 14:57:34	pjb	(defmacro mact (x) (if (integerp x) (if (zerop x) '1 `(* ,x (mact ,(1- x)))) `(fact ,x)))
2013-11-10 14:57:37	fredmorcos	in the case of the infix macro, i would use listp to find out whether it should recur or not...?
2013-11-10 14:58:03	pjb	(macroexpand '(mact 4)) --> (* 4 (mact 3))
2013-11-10 14:58:22	beach	fredmorcos: You probably don't have to in your example.  It will nest properly anyway.
2013-11-10 14:58:26	pjb	(swank::macroexpand-all '(mact 4)) --> (* 4 (* 3 (* 2 (* 1 1))))
2013-11-10 14:59:36	beach	fredmorcos: (^ (^ (1 + 2)) + (^ (3 + 4))) should work automatically.
2013-11-10 15:01:25	fredmorcos	beach, what i would like to achieve now is a recursive infix macro --> (^ ((1 + 2) + (3 + 4)))
2013-11-10 15:02:11	fredmorcos	but it seems like (1 + 2) and (3 + 4) get evaluated before the macro is called
2013-11-10 15:02:42	beach	fredmorcos: That doesn't sound right.
2013-11-10 15:04:05	beach	fredmorcos: And yes, in this case, you would have to test whether the argument is an atom or not.  But listp won't do.  Use consp.
2013-11-10 15:05:11	pjb	But the truely recursive macro would be a macro that uses itself in is body, not in its result.  Unfortunately, since the macro would have to be defined to be able to define itself, it's not possible without calling macroexpand explicitely.
2013-11-10 15:05:41	pjb	fredmorcos: you can use *macroexpand-hook* to trace when the macros are expanded.
2013-11-10 15:06:30	beach	fredmorcos: Try writing a recursive helper function, say infix-to-prefix that transforms a (possibly nested) infix expression to prefix.
2013-11-10 15:06:39	beach	fredmorcos: Then use that function in the macro.

2013-11-11 18:31:07	abunchofdollarsi	I will rephrase.

2013-11-11 18:34:41	segv-	abunchofdollarsi: you can not do that; i would suggest either changing your hierarchy into 3 classes (so your base class becomes a sister of your current derived class and only the actually common functionality lives in the parent class of both)
2013-11-11 18:34:43	sellout-	abunchofdollarsi: You can either check the exact class at the beginning of the before method, or play with method combinations.
2013-11-11 18:34:43	pjb	I don't think that's possible.

2013-11-11 22:04:52	jasom	bah, humbug.  Apparently capitalize-string is defiend to convert"foo's" to "Foo'S"
2013-11-11 22:05:05	jasom	since ' is non-alphanumeric
2013-11-11 22:07:31	dlowe	I use (string-capitalize str :end 1) a lot
2013-11-11 22:08:22	jasom	isn't that the same as string-upcase str :end 1?
2013-11-11 22:08:43	dlowe	sure.
2013-11-11 22:08:59	dlowe	but the former conveys intent better
2013-11-11 22:10:06	pjb	Notice also the difference between ' and ’

2013-11-11 22:12:18	dlowe	Sure, if you wanted to capitalize the words "a", "in", "an", etc

2013-11-11 22:12:49	jasom	so it's strictly better for my use
2013-11-11 22:12:53	dlowe	they probably should have just not included string-capitalize in any case

2013-11-11 22:35:34	jasom	For the most part, the asymptotic boundings on trees are as good or better than on hash-tables.  Constant factors make hash-tables better
2013-11-11 22:36:32	jasom	e.g. a patricia tree has O(k) lookup, which is the same as a hash-table, but it also lets you output a sorted list in O(n) time, which hash-tables generally don't allow

2013-11-11 22:50:56	jasom	Oolo0: how long does it take to hash a key?
2013-11-11 22:51:02	Oolo0	jasom: 1
2013-11-11 22:51:02	jasom	O(k) where k is the key-length
2013-11-11 22:52:24	jasom	Oolo0: with most hash-functions it takes longer to hash "This is a really long key that I am going to insert into my associative data structure" than to hash "x"
2013-11-11 22:53:12	jasom	pretty much all fast hash functions, it's linear in the key-length (it would be dumb in most cases to use a super-linear time hash function for a hash table)
2013-11-11 22:53:13	Oolo0	jasom: but it's even longer to traverse n nodes of tree comparing thing to decide where to go
2013-11-11 22:54:36	Oolo0	jasom: so your point is that tries are more efficient than hash table?
2013-11-11 22:54:50	Oolo0	for lookup
2013-11-11 22:55:21	jasom	Oolo0: it takes either a maximum of k operations for a trie or for a key
2013-11-11 22:55:44	jasom	Oolo0: but hash-tables are faster because of constant factors.  Asymptotic complexity is the same or better for tries vs. hash-tables
2013-11-11 22:56:44	jasom	Mainly it's that reading consecutive bytes is far faster than reading non-consecutive words
2013-11-11 22:57:13	Oolo0	jasom: okay, thanks for explanation
2013-11-11 22:58:16	<--	Oolo0 has quit (Quit: leaving)
2013-11-11 22:58:18	jasom	Also it takes a bit of work to make a hash-table that is O(1) with respect to the number of keys in it (you need to grow at the right time, and handle collisions gracefully, etc)
2013-11-11 22:58:50	oGMo	jasom: "bit of work" = "usually not"
2013-11-11 22:59:19	oGMo	if you can build a perfect hash you can get O(k) but otherwise it's going to be worse

2013-11-12 13:37:41	stassats	didi: i don't see why you would suggest that
2013-11-12 13:37:49	Kromitvs	I want to print some debug values. But be able to switch them all off, and only print the expected result by changing a variable (instead of comment/uncomment prints).
2013-11-12 13:38:33	Kromitvs	I'm a lisp begginer (if you didn't figur it out already...)
2013-11-12 13:38:46	didi	Kromitvs: You can use a fancy format.
2013-11-12 13:39:33	didi	Kromitvs: PAIP has one. I'll find it for you. One sec.
2013-11-12 13:39:45	stassats	Kromitvs: do you want to change it and not recompile?
2013-11-12 13:39:46	Kromitvs	thanks
2013-11-12 13:39:58	stassats	because even checking a variable is expensive, you may want to avoid compiling it in
2013-11-12 13:40:34	Kromitvs	well, this is is small project. But if there is a way that doens't require recompiling I would certainly like to know about it

2013-11-12 13:43:22	didi	Kromitvs: If you are using SBCL, you might have a problem defining the `debug' function, as `debug' is a locked symbol.
2013-11-12 13:43:42	stassats	STilda: run it many times, if it doesn't exhaust the stack, then it's optimized

2013-11-12 13:50:51	prxq	well, if an error happens, you end up in the debugger. Same thing if you put a (break) anywhere in your code and that part gets executed.
2013-11-12 13:51:14	prxq	Usually, doing (/ 1 0) is enough to land you in the debugger.
2013-11-12 13:51:25	prxq	at the repl, I mean.
2013-11-12 13:51:34	prxq	you get backtraces, etc.

2013-11-12 14:16:09	prxq	kaan: also, you need an editor (preferably emacs) that helps you with the parentheses. Then it is not a problem.
2013-11-12 14:16:14	dim	fe[nl]ix: in particular I quite like the way the parser is done (thanks to pjb), which encourages clean internal API and should make it easy for lispers to find their way
2013-11-12 14:16:19	pavelpenev	kaan: yes, you might have too few brackets. My day job is python, and significant whitespace is just a pain.
2013-11-12 14:16:57	dim	fe[nl]ix: take any test file, pass it to (pgloader.parser::parse-commands-from-file "/path/to/command.load"), and you have lisp code to read that shows how to use the whole pgloader internal API ;-)
2013-11-12 14:17:19	kaan	prxq, i use vim, it's okay. and pavelpenev significant whitespace FTW !
2013-11-12 14:18:47	pavelpenev	kaan: Significant whitespace is the single biggest mistake python made, rivaled only by having statements be different from expressions. In combination that makes python lambdas pretty much useless, as well as many other unintended side effects.

2013-11-12 15:04:02	loke__	I'm having a discussion with pkuhong on Reddit where he claims that SORT is guaranteed to modify a vector in-place, while I claim it's not guaranteed. Now, if it had been anyone else, I'd be sure of myself, but now I'm not so sure. Am I misreading the spec? And if so, how?

2013-11-12 15:07:26	-->	clmsy has joined #lisp
2013-11-12 15:07:57	ogamita	Well, theorically, if you sort a sequence of mutable object, you could copy the mutable object over one another, to avoid modifying the sequence.
2013-11-12 15:08:13	ogamita	But this would be a very strong and bad side effect, which is clearly not intended for CL:SORT.
2013-11-12 15:08:24	<--	sytse has quit (Quit: reboot)
2013-11-12 15:08:43	ogamita	Therefore the only case where SORT will NOT modify its argument, it's when the elements are already in sorted order!
2013-11-12 15:08:56	loke__	ogamita: It isn't? Then why did they take the effort to write that note? Also, the example code explitly SETQ's the result.
2013-11-12 15:09:14	stassats	notes are not actually a part of the standard
2013-11-12 15:09:17	ogamita	Notice that for lists, CL:SORT may just modify the CAR cells, without changing the list structure, or may on the other hand change the CDR cells, without modifying the CAR cells.
2013-11-12 15:09:20	ogamita	Or it can do both.
2013-11-12 15:10:14	loke__	stassats: Fair enough, but this statement also strongly suggests that a different vector could be returned: "If sequence is a vector, the result is a vector that has the same actual array element type as sequence."

2013-11-12 15:11:33	loke__	stassats: Right. So relying on SORT modifying a vector in-place would be wrong, yes? And as such, shouldn't SBCL warn if you don't? (like it does for sorting lists)

2013-11-12 15:14:48	fe[nl]ix	it works very well
2013-11-12 15:14:58	ogamita	On the other hand, there's this sentence in the description of sort (therefore stronger than the note): "In the case of a vector argument, this is accomplished by permuting the elements in place." which indicates that the original is modified to be sorted when sort returns.
2013-11-12 15:15:18	loke__	ogamita: Yeah, but read the sentence that just preceeds it

2013-11-12 15:17:00	ogamita	And I was wrong about setting the CAR, since "In the case of a list, the list is destructively reordered in the same manner as for nreverse.", which means setting the CDR.

2013-11-12 15:20:33	ogamita	But they apply only when the first sentence is active, when the operation is destructive.  When the operation is not destructive, the note applies.

2013-11-12 19:41:47	meingbg	pjb: Is there a persistence layer as well? Does converting data form view to model mean that it ends up on disk?

2013-11-12 22:00:30	-->	gendl has joined #lisp
2013-11-12 22:00:54	fredmorcos	basically i get the feeling that the common lisp is more a computing environment rather a programming language
2013-11-12 22:01:02	dlowe	fredmorcos: um, it's quite easy
2013-11-12 22:01:21	dlowe	same old thing. you open files, you read them, you write them, you close them
2013-11-12 22:02:18	fredmorcos	dlowe, that is OK. what i am talking about is things like getting the arguments passed on the command line is "implementation dependent"
2013-11-12 22:02:51	fredmorcos	dlowe, also, creating an executable binary means dumping the state of the computing environment with your program loaded in
2013-11-12 22:02:51	dlowe	fredmorcos: you're going to ask yourself if you really care about implementation dependence.  Most library writers do, most app writers don't
2013-11-12 22:03:32	fredmorcos	dlowe, good point

2013-11-12 22:03:57	dlowe	fredmorcos: you could also say that a C compiler creates a non-running computing environment, and then dumps that to disk
2013-11-12 22:04:19	fredmorcos	dlowe, that i will have to disagree with :)
2013-11-12 22:04:30	sellout-	fredmorcos: You might try Didier’s CLON library for dealing with command-line options / dumping a standalone binary.
2013-11-12 22:04:43	Fare	fredmorcos: uiop and asdf's program-op are you friend
2013-11-12 22:04:49	dlowe	admittedly, you get a lot more baggage with a lisp image than you do with libc linked in
2013-11-12 22:04:49	sellout-	(I think there is a name-clash with CLON – Didier’s is the Command-Line Option Nuker)
2013-11-12 22:04:56	Fare	CLON is fancy. My own command-line-arguments library works, too
2013-11-12 22:05:08	sellout-	Fare: There’s a program-op now?
2013-11-12 22:05:13	Fare	If you like fancy, definitely get CLON.
2013-11-12 22:05:25	Fare	sellout: since last february, released with ASDF 2.27 aka ASDF 3.
2013-11-12 22:05:37	 *	sellout- <- for when you want answers over a year out of date.
2013-11-12 22:05:51	Fare	2.27 was the initial pre-release of ASDF 3. Actual ASDF 3.0 was in may.
2013-11-12 22:05:52	fredmorcos	I hope they're command-line parsing libraries! what I was hoping for was getting argv into a list, and doing the parsing myself as an exercise
2013-11-12 22:06:11	Fare	if you use program-op, your arguments are in *command-line-arguments*
2013-11-12 22:06:17	fredmorcos	needing a library just to get argv in an implementation independent way is........
2013-11-12 22:06:31	Fare	actually, if you use uiop, which program-op does.
2013-11-12 22:06:46	fredmorcos	what is program-op and uiop?
2013-11-12 22:06:46	sellout-	fredmorcos: CLON does all the parsing stuff, defaults, --help output, etc.
2013-11-12 22:06:46	Fare	program-op used to exist only for ECL, now it's available for all.
2013-11-12 22:06:59	Fare	uiop is the runtime library used by asdf3.
2013-11-12 22:07:15	Fare	program-op is the way you create programs with asdf3.
2013-11-12 22:07:23	sellout-	Fare: Is program-op (on ECL) what used to be build-op, or is it something else? I think I used build-op to make dylibs.
2013-11-12 22:07:30	sellout-	Well, .sos.
2013-11-12 22:07:53	fredmorcos	Fare, is this it? http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/
2013-11-12 22:08:10	fredmorcos	Fare, and what is its relation to sbcl? is it a different implementation of CL?
2013-11-12 22:08:18	Fare	asdf-ecl used to have plenty of secondary operations. I made it a portable extension to ASDF last year, called ASDF-Bundle, but some parts like program-op were still ECL only.
2013-11-12 22:08:49	Fare	Starting with ASDF3, it's available on all implementations that allow this kind of things.

2013-11-12 22:09:44	Fare	I'm sure you could extend the list with a bit of hacking.
2013-11-12 22:10:37	Fare	asdf is a software construction library for CL. It was originally written by a SBCL hacker for SBCL  Dan Barlow, who since retired from CL hacking.

2013-11-12 22:12:30	Fare	in any case, these days, ASDF is a robust portable piece of software to build CL software

2013-11-12 22:28:19	fredmorcos	Fare, a library for putting argv into a list just for portability? I expect that to be part of my program already, the compiler/VM/interpreter/runtime should take care of that. I mean, why is this implementation dependent in the first place?
2013-11-12 22:28:58	H4ns	fredmorcos: it is implementation dependent because the cl standard is very old.
2013-11-12 22:29:16	H4ns	fredmorcos: it is from a time where in many operating systems, you would not have such a thing as "command line arguments"
2013-11-12 22:29:53	fredmorcos	thanks H4ns, are there any plans to update it somewhat?
2013-11-12 22:30:13	H4ns	fredmorcos: no.  the common lisp standard will not be updated in the foreseeable future
2013-11-12 22:30:23	fredmorcos	OK, thanks!

2013-11-12 22:32:20	Fare	francogrex, xcvb has fallen behind, indeed. Unless you want parallelism above all.
2013-11-12 22:32:47	Fare	fredmorcos, you can have it without the library, or you can have it portably with the library
2013-11-12 22:32:48	-->	thelorax123 has joined #lisp
2013-11-12 22:32:55	foom	that whole model of thinking "need money to fund another ansi committee!" is a rather outdated way of thinking about how to go about creating languages.
2013-11-12 22:32:59	Fare	said library is available via (require "asdf") which is itself portable.
2013-11-12 22:33:54	Fare	abcl ccl clisp cmucl ecl sbcl and allegro provide asdf3, which includes uiop.
2013-11-12 22:34:02	H4ns	what about genera?
2013-11-12 22:34:03	H4ns	:D
2013-11-12 22:34:25	Fare	H4ns: if there is ever a new distribution of genera, I'm pretty sure it with include asdf, too.
2013-11-12 22:34:28	Shinmera	foom: It isn't about creating a new language, it's about updating the standard for an existing one.
2013-11-12 22:34:50	H4ns	Fare: ha, the old one is not modern enough for you, i see.

2013-11-12 22:35:12	foom	Yeah, well, the path to an updated CL certainly does not lie through a new ANSI standard. If it ever happens, it'll be through community pushing for common functionality.
2013-11-12 22:35:35	Fare	I'm pretty sure the next lispworks, gcl, scl, mkcl releases will have asdf3, too.
2013-11-12 22:36:09	Shinmera	foom: I heavily doubt that, because if there's one thing that'll never reach an agreement, it's a community.

2013-11-14 22:13:14	mathrick	that's how that happened, I'm not entirely sure tbh why compile
2013-11-14 22:13:27	mathrick	I need to re-read all that and understand it again
2013-11-14 22:14:00	Bike	Oh. I see. The "clause compilers" are side-effectful.
2013-11-14 22:14:06	Bike	That's incredibly nasty.
2013-11-14 22:14:15	Bike	I think I'm impressed?
2013-11-14 22:15:05	dlowe	perhaps another version of iterate can be made that isn't backwards compatible with iterate's exact feature set, but has a sane backend that supports all the use cases
2013-11-14 22:15:12	Bike	I think this sort of thing is what compiler-let was for.

2013-11-14 22:26:48	Bike	yes, the bit starting "(define-clause-compiler :collect"
2013-11-14 22:27:13	mathrick	trying to understand what clause compilers actually do, and how they relate to COMPILE still
2013-11-14 22:27:47	mathrick	because that came later, and I still don't see the need for COMPILE which was pretty much the first thing mentioned when we were talking about codewalking and the necessity thereof
2013-11-14 22:28:24	Bike	before returning the actual result of the macroexpansion, the iter macro compiles some special code. that code is just the same forms as the iter macro is taking, but wrapped in a macrolet that establishes a macro for each clause that is the "clause compiler" (as opposed to the "clause expander" which is used in the actual macroexpanded iteration)

2013-11-14 22:28:48	-->	macin has joined #lisp
2013-11-14 22:28:56	Bike	so, COMPILE compiles that lambda, which means going through and expanding all the macros in the right places, so that (let ((collect ...)) ...) isn't expanded but (let () (collect ...)) is
2013-11-14 22:29:22	Bike	those macroexpanders, the "clause compilers", alter the dynamic bindings established in the progv
2013-11-14 22:29:35	Bike	the result of the compile is then discarded but the altered dynamic bindings are kept
2013-11-14 22:30:23	mathrick	whoa, PROGV
2013-11-14 22:30:57	mathrick	"Notes: Among other things, progv is useful when writing interpreters for languages embedded in Lisp; it provides a handle on the mechanism for binding dynamic variables."
2013-11-14 22:31:37	optikalmouse	mathrick: WOAH
2013-11-14 22:31:47	Bike	so, for example, with a (collect ...) clause, the clause compiler adds a variable to the initial bindings, to hold the collected list
2013-11-14 22:31:52	Vivitron	mathrick: note that unlike (let (...) (declare (special ...))) progv computes the variable it is binding dynamically
2013-11-14 22:31:54	Bike	and then the clause expander can just use that variable
2013-11-14 22:32:01	mathrick	Vivitron: yes, I get that
2013-11-14 22:32:02	cmm	that sounds prone to unintended compile-time side-effects in the client code, but otherwise very impressive

2013-11-20 21:54:45	Choovoo	Yanez: 1 level deep at least, i mean it should copy struct foo and all nested structs in that foo struct.
2013-11-20 21:55:37	Yanez	choo: your answer explains why there's no builtin deep-copy... because lisp cannot know what 'deep-copy' means for you in each case
2013-11-20 21:56:00	Choovoo	Yanez: okay, it should copy recursively every newted struct

2013-11-20 21:56:16	Choovoo	is it fair defintion of deep copy?
2013-11-20 21:56:43	Yanez	choo: no, because slots can contain other types of objects...
2013-11-20 21:56:54	-->	ustunozg_ has joined #lisp
2013-11-20 21:57:05	Yanez	for example, let's say that one of your slots contains a list of arrays in which some of the elements (but not all) are structs
2013-11-20 21:57:19	Yanez	what should your deep-copy do in this case?
2013-11-20 21:58:19	Choovoo	Yanez: so there is no way to tell if slot value is a struct?
2013-11-20 21:58:27	Choovoo	Yanez: everything i guess
2013-11-20 21:58:29	Yanez	yes, of course...
2013-11-20 21:59:23	Yanez	what I'm trying to say is that the meaning of deep-copy is not known a priori, it's up to you to decide what it means
2013-11-20 21:59:37	Choovoo	ah i forgot that structs in cl are lacking of introspection and you can't just (loop for field in (fields struct) do ...) .

2013-11-20 22:03:47	Yanez	choovoo: is there a reason why you want to use defstructs and not clos objects?
2013-11-20 22:04:08	stassats	Choovoo: that is going to be restricted to the structures you are defining
2013-11-20 22:04:25	stassats	there are implementation-dependent ways of getting structure slots

2013-11-24 14:50:15	MikeSeth	happens often with irc servers that are not intended for public consumption (e.g. embedded in games, social apps_
2013-11-24 14:52:04	w|t	that's what i was thinking, but the networks i'm connecting to are fairly "standard" and compatible with most, if not all, irc clients MikeSeth.

2013-11-24 14:57:42	MikeSeth	w|t: it may be the client is too conservative in interpreting protocol initialization
2013-11-24 14:58:09	MikeSeth	but generally NOTICE events are not supposed to trigger behaviour, they may be completely ignored by the client
2013-11-24 14:58:30	MikeSeth	w|t: can you do a full dump of the conversation? I'm kinda familiar with RFC1459

2013-11-24 15:06:47	MikeSeth	at the very least a client is supposed to send USER and NICKNAME
2013-11-24 15:07:19	w|t	i think that may be the problem. i'm looking at the docs to see if there is a verbose mode or something.
2013-11-24 15:07:31	MikeSeth	you can dump it with wireshark or something

2013-11-24 15:09:56	MikeSeth	yeah just checked RFC, the defined behaviour is for the client to send USER and NICK and then keep replying to PING with PONG

2013-11-24 22:40:52	Bike	i don't think sbcl ever returns nil for char-code.
2013-11-24 22:41:15	Bike	eg (char-code 1114111) => #\U0010FFFF
2013-11-24 22:41:29	nicdev	that makes sense!
2013-11-24 22:41:33	Bike	so, the error code you have there is never reached.

2013-11-24 22:41:56	Bike	so i think you can ignore the note (since another implementation might not be like this)

2013-11-25 11:38:57	phadthai	hmm I tried to subtype simple-error thinking that I could possibly pass a format string directly to ERROR after datum being my condition name, but realized I should still pass key arguments; now I'm reading about condition designators which meantions the defaulted-type... should I absolutely write another function (like ERROR) if I need another defaulted-type?  That's the route I used before

2013-11-25 11:40:15	Krystof	if you want to avoid writing :format-control and :format-arguments, then you need a function, yes
2013-11-25 11:40:36	phadthai	thanks

2013-11-25 11:41:07	phadthai	I had the impression that perhaps there might have been some portable way to change the defaulted-type in another way (that specified at http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/09_aba.htm)
2013-11-25 11:41:34	phadthai	and was further confused by the notes about FORMAT accepting a function heh

2013-11-25 11:45:00	phadthai	I think I also was confused by "where the defaulted-type is a subtype of default-type.", and the fact that my condition is a subtype of simple-error

2013-11-28 14:11:46	-->	gravicappa has joined #lisp
2013-11-28 14:11:46	p_l	mathrick: the choice of a seed is important and impacts behaviour of PRNG, depending on type and task
2013-11-28 14:11:46	hitecnologys	mathrick: if you use random values to seed your seed, it may increase randomness.
2013-11-28 14:12:13	p_l	mathrick: so sometimes you need specific procedures to seed the algorithm to get certain guarantee level
2013-11-28 14:12:18	mathrick	hitecnologys: read what you wrote again
2013-11-28 14:12:22	mathrick	it makes no sense
2013-11-28 14:12:28	hitecnologys	Hmm.
2013-11-28 14:12:50	hitecnologys	Yeah, that was stupid.
2013-11-28 14:13:16	p_l	most importantly, a static seed allows for replay of typical PRNG output. Sometimes you want that, sometimes you don't :)
2013-11-28 14:13:39	mathrick	p_l: it might, but general-purpose PRNGs are usually chosen to be insensitive to particular seed choices, and anyway, you'd "seed" it by going through a PRNG anyway
2013-11-28 14:15:03	p_l	mathrick: well, that's the bit of difference between /dev/urandom and /dev/random, as well. So a big disclaimer of "if you need anything specific from randomness, be very, very careful" ;)
2013-11-28 14:15:15	mathrick	also OS-level entropy providers like /dev/(r)random whiten their output anyway
2013-11-28 14:15:40	mathrick	p_l: /dev/random is more or less deprecated in Linux
2013-11-28 14:16:45	prxq_	usually, if I want a random number, I want exactly that. So if I always get the same numbers (because the same seed is used each time I start sbcl) then that's not as random as I wanted.
2013-11-28 14:17:12	prxq_	if I want the same sequence, I can arrange for that. But that's more the exception

2013-11-28 14:18:19	mathrick	if you want a random sequence, you'd damn better initialise it
2013-11-28 14:18:24	p_l	mathrick: deprecated since when? and yes, it is whitened, because otherwise it wouldn't have necessary distribution :)
2013-11-28 14:18:34	prxq_	mathrick: sure, that's why I have that particular line in my .sbcl :-)
2013-11-28 14:18:48	prxq_	.sbclrc, even
2013-11-28 14:19:07	mathrick	p_l: and whitening means your "seeding" ain't gonna achieve squat, because urandom already has the required distribution
2013-11-28 14:19:27	mathrick	it's functionally deprecated and has been for some time, lemme find the Ts'o post
2013-11-28 14:20:02	p_l	mathrick: urandom has a bit different premise, iirc (that is, it uses the data that random gives as seed for PRNG and outputs the data from PRNG)
2013-11-28 14:20:22	mathrick	exactly, which is a higher quality result anyway
2013-11-28 14:20:42	mathrick	p_l: https://plus.google.com/+TheodoreTso/posts/SDcoemc9V3J
2013-11-28 14:20:43	p_l	I had to deal with quite recent software that refused to start till /dev/random had enough data...
2013-11-28 14:22:14	mathrick	"+David Johnston /dev/urandom doesn't block and it's what most programs use. I don't consider the /dev/random behavior to be that important and so it's kept mostly for compatibility reasons. ﻿"

2013-11-28 14:26:16	eMBee	but while we are on the topic, would it not be possible to default to a random seed, and get a predictable result by setting a static seed explicitly?
2013-11-28 14:27:24	mathrick	p_l: /dev/random is sorta like symmetric "encryption" of passwords in the DB. It only obscures your security problems by making them into problems you can't understand, not by removing them
2013-11-28 14:28:43	mathrick	there are two practical classes of software needing random state: things which need "essentially random" state that can use /dev/urandom and its built-in stretching and whitening, or things which have very specific crypto requirements, and as such shouldn't be relying on black-box mechanisms like /dev/random anyway
2013-11-28 14:30:23	mathrick	Ts'o doesn't trust /dev/random's estimates, and he wrote it, so I don't see any particular reason my crypto should without a careful analysis

After going through Ts'o's post, he says nothing like that - he even explicitly mentions difference in professed use between random and urandom, however admits that working on random is not his main job and he mostly picks up slack due to lack of proper maintainer. He also mentions that entropy estimator is not as good as it could be
2013-11-28 14:34:15	p_l	(and that majority of code uses urandom, as it should)
2013-11-28 14:35:17	p_l	good thread, btw, so thanks for the link :)
2013-11-28 14:36:08	p_l	(n.b., FreeBSD has only equivalent of urandom, with Yarrow algorithm, whose ideas are also used in how random and urandom are implemented on Linux)
2013-11-28 14:37:01	mathrick	yeah
2013-11-28 14:38:06	mathrick	p_l: but if you go further down, he actually says he doesn't believe in entropy estimation at all, because the sources the kernel uses are laden with huge and impossible to estimate error
2013-11-28 14:38:23	mathrick	stated a bit more diplomatically
2013-11-28 14:38:25	eMBee	hitecnologys: i suppose the current approach has ther advantage that if you actually need better randomness, you'll have to think more about it
2013-11-28 14:38:33	p_l	mathrick: can you quote? The thread is big and I already closed it
2013-11-28 14:38:34	mathrick	ie. "isn't convinced it's at all sensible"
2013-11-28 14:38:48	mathrick	"The reality is that trying to estimate entropy given the timing sources available to the kernel is extremely difficult.   So in the absence of real hardware support (and that's what rngd is for), entropy estimation is always going to be problematic, and probably hugely subject to error.  So that's always going to be an issue with /dev/random."
2013-11-28 14:39:22	p_l	mathrick: ... that can be interpreted in many ways. Especially given that /dev/random is not something he particularly works on

2013-11-28 14:40:58	Zhivago	Generally, general random number generators should only be used when mildly surprising numbers are required.
2013-11-28 14:41:29	Zhivago	Otherwise you'd better have worked out what statistical properties you require, and have measured the generator against it.
2013-11-28 14:41:35	mathrick	p_l: if you add 2 and 2 (and 2 and 2..., spread over that long thread), it mostly is that way. Ie. either you have some minimum-quality HW entropy source, and then you should incorporate it into /dev/urandom. It's not a good idea to use most HW sources directly anyway. Or you don't, and then you're back to square one with guesses about unknown quality measures
2013-11-28 14:42:09	mathrick	HW sources shouldn't be trusted blindly even when they're high-quality, as that thread explains
2013-11-28 14:42:35	p_l	which is why Ts'o refused the patch mentioned at the beginning
2013-11-28 14:43:33	p_l	the code I encountered, if it didn't use it's own entropy gathering method, tended to use /dev/random to for data used as seed for its chosen CPRNG

2013-11-28 14:48:54	eMBee	a friend of mine developed a method to get random values by measuring the jitter in the timing of the execution of cpu instructions (by creating a race-condition and measuring how often the race occurs.
2013-11-28 14:49:25	Zhivago	Did he measure how random it is? :)
2013-11-28 14:50:05	p_l	probably not very random :)
2013-11-28 14:50:09	eMBee	he had gigabytes of random values tested by some service doing
2013-11-28 14:50:16	eMBee	that kind of testing
2013-11-28 14:50:21	p_l	also, very, very dependant on specific cpu core
2013-11-28 14:50:29	Zhivago	And load, and ...
2013-11-28 14:50:39	p_l	for example, Niagara chips would give afaik 0 randomness
2013-11-28 14:51:10	eMBee	yes, it's cpu dependent, but you can tune the parameters to get good results for every cpu
2013-11-28 14:51:18	p_l	eMBee: not every, I believe
2013-11-28 14:51:30	eMBee	ok, every he tested so far
2013-11-28 14:52:09	p_l	eMBee: for example, how do you deal with a deterministic, in-order, barrel-type CPU?
2013-11-28 14:52:20	eMBee	he's mostly working with embedded devices that don't have a hardware random generator, that's why he came up with this in the first place

2013-11-28 14:54:41	p_l	eMBee: some cpus are embarrasingly nondeterministic

2013-11-29 11:27:05	dim	well I'm debugging it now and it's complaining that NIL is not an (unsigned-byte 8), after that I think that the column parsing needs redoing, and then maybe micro optimisations need to happen
2013-11-29 11:27:31	stassats	the original retuned two values

2013-11-29 11:34:39	dim	yeah but I mean, it looks like the loop over packets is always needed, and you basically did force disable it
2013-11-29 11:35:05	stassats	it's not always needed

2013-11-29 11:36:32	dim	ah yeah, misread the original code
2013-11-29 11:36:34	stassats	but, there's a mistake for the termination test
2013-11-29 11:37:40	stassats	there should be "until (< length +max-packet-length+)" before finally
2013-11-29 11:38:10	dim	also I'm unclear that you can't actually have an empty packet in the middle of the batch
2013-11-29 11:38:20	dim	I think the previous coding did cater for that

2013-11-29 11:39:11	dim	mmm, right
2013-11-29 11:39:30	stassats	which is only needed if the packet size is exactly +max-packet-length+
2013-11-29 11:40:13	dim	yeah, the before-to-last one in the series
2013-11-29 11:40:28	stassats	and i wouldn't probably read all the packets at once

2013-11-29 11:50:14	dim	nice.
2013-11-29 11:51:11	stassats	just that sbcl can compute things like, which type code should the array use, and by how much should it multiply/truncate the length to know the how much memory to use
2013-11-29 11:51:38	stassats	that's why it's twice as fast, it doesn't have to do that

2014-01-23 22:36:39	jackdaniel	(first link is two files paste)
2014-01-23 22:38:30	stassats	jackdaniel: apparently fingermap-qwerty.lisp calls deffinger, and that is not exported
2014-01-23 22:39:08	jackdaniel	yes it does, but it's loaded from function in another package
2014-01-23 22:39:11	stassats	and  (the symbol fingersym) is not how you make declarations or check-types
2014-01-23 22:39:14	jackdaniel	shouldn't it inherit it?
2014-01-23 22:39:22	-->	cdidd has joined #lisp
2014-01-23 22:39:36	Ayey_	I'am having some trouble with (read-line) and using it in slime. I call the function with C-x C-e, and then try to write something, when i hit enter, it's like its looking for varriables with the input. But when i try the same out in the terminal (sbcl), it works bas intented?
2014-01-23 22:39:41	stassats	jackdaniel: you're not exporting it, how can it be inherited?
2014-01-23 22:40:04	stassats	jackdaniel: to check for types, uses (check-type fingersym symbol), to declare (declare (symbol fingersym))
2014-01-23 22:40:24	stassats	only check-type is required to actually perform a type check at runtime, the declare may or may not do that
2014-01-23 22:40:47	jackdaniel	stassats: i assumed, that if fast-start is called from package :dead-corpse, then all stuff loaded on this function will be loaded in :dead-corpse package

2014-01-23 22:41:07	stassats	Ayey_: where are you entering your line?
2014-01-23 22:41:34	stassats	jackdaniel: packages concerns themselves only with symbols
2014-01-23 22:42:00	stassats	only what is explicitly exported will be inherited by a package which uses another package
2014-01-23 22:43:29	stassats	jackdaniel: and it's all textual, if fast-start itself called deffinger, then it wouldn't matter that deffinger is not exported from anywhere, since package resolution is performed at read-time
2014-01-23 22:43:48	stassats	i.e., before anything is compiled or executed

2014-01-23 22:44:13	jackdaniel	stassats: thanks, that clears alot
2014-01-23 22:44:34	jackdaniel	btw, why (the ..) isn't a good way to check type?
2014-01-23 22:44:55	stassats	it's not required to do anything useful
2014-01-23 22:45:13	Ayey_	stassats: in the slime repl
2014-01-23 22:45:29	stassats	jackdaniel: at the place where you're using it
2014-01-23 22:46:10	stassats	(1+ (the fixnum x)) is useful for, but not (lambda (x) (the fixnum x) (1+ x)), even if a smart compiler can recognize this being similar
2014-01-23 22:46:32	stassats	Ayey_: are you sure that it's not *inferior-lisp*?
2014-01-23 22:46:45	stassats	or reversal, are you sure that it's not asking in *inferior-lisp*
2014-01-23 22:47:08	stassats	if C-x C-e creates a new thread, if you don't have io redirection, it'll ask in *inferior-lisp*
2014-01-23 22:47:43	Ayey_	stassats: Oh, it is in the inferior-lisp buffer
2014-01-23 22:47:49	-->	endou has joined #lisp
2014-01-23 22:47:53	stassats	to enable, deposit (in-package #:swank) (defparameter *globally-redirect-io* t) into ~/.swank.lisp
2014-01-23 22:48:00	stassats	(and restart)
2014-01-23 22:48:30	stassats	protip ",restart" in the repl would achieve that

2014-01-23 22:51:36	Ayey_	stassats: Should the restart take long?
2014-01-23 22:52:25	stassats	i/o redirection is actually not required for read-line to work in the repl, strangely enough
2014-01-23 22:52:40	jackdaniel	it works \o/ :)

2014-01-23 22:53:17	Ayey_	What's the differnce between slime-repl and inferior-lisp? 
2014-01-23 22:53:22	Ayey_	If there is a differnce
2014-01-23 22:53:45	stassats	inferior-lisp shouldn't be used normally
2014-01-23 22:53:59	jackdaniel	Ayey_: slime-repl offers you few nice features, like package designator, autocompletion etc
2014-01-23 22:54:03	stassats	it's basically useless
2014-01-23 22:54:38	stassats	only useful for seeing output of some FFI which output to stdout

2014-01-23 22:57:38	stassats	global io redirection takes care of that, unless you deliberately print to sb-sys:*stdout*
2014-01-23 22:57:54	Ayey_	Okay, who do i default to slime-repl then? (Instead of inferior-lisp?
2014-01-23 22:58:07	Ayey_	And thanks for explaining!
2014-01-23 22:58:25	ener2	is there a way to change help definition of macro or is taht implementation specific?

2014-01-23 23:00:03	ener2	stassats: lambdalist but only in help
2014-01-23 23:00:27	stassats	arglist display? it's more like IDE dependent
2014-01-23 23:00:59	stassats	Ayey_: (slime-setup '(slime-repl)) in .emacs, and (in-package #:swank) (defparameter *globally-redirect-io* t) in ~/.swank.lisp
2014-01-23 23:01:19	stassats	(slime-setup '(slime-fancy)) is usually better

2014-01-23 23:04:28	redscare	does anyone use gsll? the eigenvalues that I get out of it are consistently wrong. i believe this is a severe bug but it doesn't seem to be mentoined elsewhere
2014-01-23 23:04:55	stassats	LiamH: may or may not use gsll
2014-01-23 23:05:08	LiamH	I do, but I don't do eigenvalues
2014-01-23 23:05:34	stassats	no wonder they are wrong then
2014-01-23 23:05:52	LiamH	Really, it should just be calling GSL and returning the value.
2014-01-23 23:06:18	Ayey_	It works now, thanks stassats!
2014-01-23 23:06:33	stassats	LiamH: there could be ffi problems
2014-01-23 23:06:46	stassats	well, redscare owes a test case
2014-01-23 23:07:53	ener2	is there a way from symbol to know whether class with that name is subclass of other class?
2014-01-23 23:08:13	stassats	(subtypep symbol superclass)

2014-01-23 23:08:21	ener2	thank you
2014-01-23 23:08:43	stassats	works both as (subtypep 'fixnum 'integer) and (subtypep (find-class 'fixnum) (find-class 'integer))
2014-01-23 23:08:56	stassats	since class objects are types too
