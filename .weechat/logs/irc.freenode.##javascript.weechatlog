2013-11-11 21:07:40	ImBcmDth	pbodymind: 2) typed arrays are a LOT more memory efficient than regular arrays for dense stuff (like pixel data) 3) if you are allocating a lot of short-lived objects interspersed by a few longer-lived objects, you can run into "arena fragmentation" in firefox (they might have fixed this in more recent builds). FF allocates "arenas" that are (i think) a MB in size. only when EVERY object in an arena is GCd can the arena be freed. If even one byte
2013-11-11 21:07:40	ImBcmDth	hangs around, then whole arena is wasted.

2013-11-11 22:37:18	Wafamde	j201 - That makes sense
2013-11-11 22:37:26	phelix	yansanmo: one of the images is very large. So soon as the page loads I want it to display http://boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/sites/boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/themes/boguscreek/images/snow-bg.png in the background. And once the large image http://boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/sites/boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/themes/boguscreek/images/snow-large.gif is done loading. I want it
2013-11-11 22:37:26	phelix	to change the background url to that one instead.
2013-11-11 22:37:34	yansanmo	my fiddle says: load the img src (but doesn't display the img), when it's fully loaded, show it as background
2013-11-11 22:37:39	Wafamde	I did suspect that at one point, but had so many ideas floating around my head that I forgot to test that :D
2013-11-11 22:37:40	Wafamde	Thanks a million :)
2013-11-11 22:38:06	phelix	seems in that example you gave me there is only one image. Where it needs to change to the http://boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/sites/boguscreek.dev.tributemedia.com/themes/boguscreek/images/snow-large.gif once it is finished downloading.

2013-11-11 22:39:17	phelix	I am willing to do it whatever way works best. I just do not know much js =(
2013-11-11 22:39:22	phelix	Id rather not use an img tag at all
2013-11-11 22:39:27	phelix	just want it in the css

2013-11-11 22:41:53	phelix	good. I was hoping to not have that tag in there. I didn't want it in there anyway.
2013-11-11 22:42:02	phelix	But now while the large one is downloading. Can it display the smaller image in the process?
2013-11-11 22:42:25	yansanmo	what small  img?

2013-11-11 22:42:41	phelix	cause this background image is like 20Megs. Need the snow-bg.png needs to load while snow-large.gif is downloading
2013-11-11 22:43:05	GreenJello	phelix, turn snow-bg.png into a datauri
2013-11-11 22:43:15	GreenJello	scale it down a lot first
2013-11-11 22:43:19	phelix	so basically snow-bg.png is just a place holder to display until snow-large.gif finishes downloading
2013-11-11 22:43:36	yansanmo	then it should be the other way around...
2013-11-11 22:43:39	phelix	GreenJello the .gif is animated. I can't scale it down
2013-11-11 22:43:43	yansanmo	the png in the CSS, and the gif in the JS
