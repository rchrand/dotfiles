There is event.eat.info on elements that exceed the height of 10 (pixels) - I have a .timeline > event.eat {} in the CSS that defines {background: green;} and the .timeline > .event.eat.info that defines {background-image : url('foo.jpg')}

2013-12-03 14:45:19	charlie_sanders	looper, yeah, you're trying to access data before it gets loaded, you can do myResource.query(function(data) { ... use data here ... } ) , in this case, but IMO it's better to access the data in the view not the controller
2013-12-03 14:46:10	charlie_sanders	so, use a callback instead of waiting for data to change, the view part will redraw when $scope.data is changed, but your controller will not get notified in that way
2013-12-03 14:48:39	chakkimatti	okay got it.. I think.. I added the part I need to bootstrap.css (thats bad, right?) but now it works - just that the border-radius wont take affect :( https://gist.github.com/anonymous/835f7918df730e4d0d5e

I know how to set up different routes to different controllers so that you can change the URL and thus the view... but if you want to keep the same controller, or have one main controller that keeps the data and use sub-controllers for views, as with a wizard, how do you swap between views?

2013-12-03 17:39:37	twelverobots	Controllers can communicate with each other, so if you did need data from multiple Controllers in one div it shouldn't be hard to accomplish, sh

2013-12-03 17:40:08	kba	I tried ng-click="A.method()", hoping I could invote method() on my Controller A.

2013-12-03 17:40:42	kba	I also tried ng-clikc="$emit('test') having an $scope.$on('test'), test) but with no luck either
2013-12-03 17:41:02	kba	Any suggestions on how to do this? Calling a method on another controller.
2013-12-03 17:41:33	cthrax	kba, you might try using a service instead of talking to controllers directly
2013-12-03 17:41:45	cthrax	let the service between the communication medium
2013-12-03 17:42:07	c0bra	kba: what you are probably wanting to do is call $emit in a function in your controller, and put that function into the scope, then call that in ng-click
2013-12-03 17:42:09	cthrax	I use an eventBus style service for communicating between controllers myself

2013-12-03 17:43:09	jude0_	so I am trying to detect when I file input has changed apparently ng-change doesn't work for that on 1.2? Any ideas other than onchange="angular.element(this).scope().calledFunction()"?

2013-12-03 17:44:21	kba	c0bra: But how does that help me? That means I have to put that function into the scope as well. That is my problem.
2013-12-03 17:44:46	kba	c0bra: Or do you mean I should create a function on the scope, not in a controller, that does an emit which is read from my controller?

2013-12-03 17:46:38	kba	cthrax: Isn't calling controllers directly from my template usually the way to do it? That's what I see in all the examples.

2013-12-03 17:48:13	cthrax	kba, that's definitely how you want to make the call to the service, but if I understand what you're trying to do, it's to communicate to multiple controllers from another controller, so you want to do that via a service

2013-12-03 18:19:03	felipesabino	Merminghi: thats what I said, it depends on what you want... if firing angular watcher is your only issue then yes, use only $apply... but if you have an issue with other things happening "at the same time" (like the DOM, for example), then it is better to use a timeout... there is a very good article from jresig about how timer work and the single thread
2013-12-03 18:19:03	felipesabino	issue in JS that might as well be useful http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/

2013-12-03 22:11:45	SimpleAsCouldBe	c0bra -- I updated mine based on your working example.
2013-12-03 22:11:45	SimpleAsCouldBe	http://plnkr.co/edit/yxbynbnWIy8iK2vG4sDK?p=preview
2013-12-03 22:12:06	SimpleAsCouldBe	still don't have an 'ah-ha' where I see why I can $watch properties of a service, but if I pull the property reference into local scope I can't watch it directly
2013-12-03 22:12:19	Merminghi	c0bra: who provides socket.io? I've included <script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"/> in my header and the angular-socket-io script in the body. Shouldn't / doesn't the browser provide s.io (else any client would have to have s.io installed)... I'm confused ;-P
2013-12-03 22:12:54	-->	gnrlbzik has joined #angularjs
2013-12-03 22:13:04	SimpleAsCouldBe	I feel like ideally you shouldn't have to provide the whole service in the controller's scope
2013-12-03 22:13:53	teslanick	Merminghi: socket.io is a library that shims over the differences in doing WebSockets-like functionality.
2013-12-03 22:13:54	c0bra	Merminghi: socket.io is its own library http://socket.io
2013-12-03 22:13:59	caitp	SimpleAsCouldBe: the reality of javascript is this: objects are shared by reference, numbers and strings (not Strings) aren't
2013-12-03 22:14:18	caitp	if you change a number or string value and it's not attached to a reference, nobody else is going to see that
2013-12-03 22:14:28	-->	djvirgen has joined #angularjs
2013-12-03 22:14:29	Merminghi	c0bra: yes, npm install socket.io -- but do my target users have to install socket.io as well?
2013-12-03 22:14:45	c0bra	Merminghi: you need to include the client library on your page, just like angular.js
2013-12-03 22:15:28	caitp	if the number or string is attached to an object that other people are looking at, then changes to that object-bound string/number will be seen
2013-12-03 22:15:53	Merminghi	c0bra: I have <script ... "angular-socket-io.js"/> in the body, along with the other usual suspects.  angular-socket-io is not sufficient ?
2013-12-03 22:15:55	caitp	(through the shared object, not through anything else)
2013-12-03 22:16:05	Merminghi	c0bra: (sorry, I'm really confused)
2013-12-03 22:16:12	caitp	there is nothing that Angular can really do about this

2013-12-03 22:17:05	SimpleAsCouldBe	I'm getting there... I thought Angular polled all the values and compared them against the previous value it knew about. This is not so?

2013-12-03 22:17:36	caitp	what happens is this: angular has a process called a "digest" which doesn't happen automatically
2013-12-03 22:17:41	caitp	it happens during bootstrap, and subsequently when it's asked for
2013-12-03 22:17:56	caitp	when a digest happens, every $watch gets evaluated
2013-12-03 22:17:56	SimpleAsCouldBe	I think $rootScope.$apply tirggers digest, right?
2013-12-03 22:18:07	c0bra	Merminghi: no, you need socket.io.js on your client; http://cdnjs.com/libraries/socket.io/
2013-12-03 22:18:15	c0bra	Merminghi: there's a SERVER library and a CLIENT library
2013-12-03 22:18:19	c0bra	the client library is used in the browser
2013-12-03 22:18:28	caitp	$watch doesn't have to care about things in scope (you can watch the result of a function, for instance)
2013-12-03 22:18:28	-->	adifah has joined #angularjs
2013-12-03 22:18:52	caitp	but it doesn't change the rules of javascript --- it will not poll every single variable in the VM

2013-12-03 22:19:10	caitp	so you're responsible for telling it what to watch and making sure that the watches are effective

2013-12-03 22:20:16	SimpleAsCouldBe	But I'm literally telling it "hey duder, watch the .val prop on my $scope": $scope.$watch('val', function(val){ ... }
2013-12-03 22:20:39	caitp	sure, but that's only going to matter if $scope.val changes
2013-12-03 22:20:48	SimpleAsCouldBe	how does that interact with whether $scope.val is a reference or value?

Why is then, that when I click the clearlabel, instead of clear() being called, foo() is called? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1b48bdhttps://gist.github.com/anonymous/bb37733e92a4d0f99482

2013-12-04 15:21:57	maartenst	hi. Does anyone know if something changed with handling of the $parsers array or something related from 1.0 to 1.2? We had custom validators being push()ed to the array, and they would work, but upon updating to 1.2 it seems we have to unshift them.
2013-12-04 15:22:12	theblackbox	ppppaul: cool, I've got something in that direction, just wondering if there is something formalised for angular that I'm missing as "diff" is a rather useless search term ;)

2013-12-04 15:48:15	maartenst	I always though you could write multiple validation directives and have them all validate at the same time, but looking at it now it seems that because they have to return undefined for the value if they are not valid, you can't, or am I not understanding ti?

2013-12-04 16:15:43	theblackbox	hello all, I'm trying to hunt down a pesky $watchCollection that keeps firing the moment I read my entity. I've diff'ed and delta'd and I can't see any differences in the newObj from the oldObj. Does anyone have any pointers for what could be happening? i.e. I'm pretty sure you'd have to look at the code to diagnose this, but then again I might just be missing something angular does in the background... I suspected the hash keys may have
2013-12-04 16:15:43	theblackbox	been something to keep an eye on, but my (possibly incorrect) diff doesn't show up any differences even there

I was under the impression that I could combine (custom) validation directives and then have them all report back their respective errors, but it seems that only one error can be reported at a time because after one invalid result the model value becomes undefined?

2013-12-04 19:34:29	Guest83306	I love ng-repeat, but I am a little sadden that it seems that it will only accept collections. I have a under inputed number that controls how many elements should create (and can be changed on the page), but it seems like I have to make an array that, is for the most point, meaningless.

2013-12-04 20:31:15	maartenst	Iám looking into the $parsers chain for validators. I was under the impression that I could combine (custom) validation directives and then have them all report back their respective errors, but it seems that only one error can be reported at a time because after one invalid result the model value becomes undefined?

If I'm on /localhost:80 and am on a tab in my webapp that sets $routeProvider to, say, /ws-test, the url is /localhost/ws-test. What is the relation of this url to the url required to create a new WebSocket obj? I am confused on this point.

2013-12-04 21:39:18	monk12	Hey all, quick question... It relates to these 3 ways of creating a module i saw: I see on Angular's docs on how to create a new module with the 1st two ways. the 3rd way though I didn't see anyway. Can someone point to the docs or api that shows you can confiigure a provider by giving a 3rd function parameter?

Love the framework :) But how would I go about executing a logic of "if info button of event $index is pressed, open it next to event $index and display event $index info?

2013-12-05 08:44:33	kamoricks	chakkimatti: In an ng-repeat, you only have access to the current item, and the index of the current item. That really should be enough for your controller to figure out the rest.
2013-12-05 08:44:55	tezla	chakkimatti: ng-click="open(item.id)" to button and implement $scope.open on your controller

2013-12-05 08:52:48	jormo	hi guys, i'm new to angular... is there documentation somewhere for things like "input()", "select()", "repeater()", etc... that i see in the tutorial?
2013-12-05 08:52:54	jormo	i can't find them listed in the documentation
2013-12-05 08:53:45	jormo	?
2013-12-05 08:53:47	jormo	what's that

2013-12-05 08:55:19	Varun_Krishna	did you take a look at the official docs?
2013-12-05 08:55:26	jormo	see those mysterious functions?
2013-12-05 08:55:33	jormo	input(), select(), repeater(), etc?
2013-12-05 08:55:47	jormo	yes, they're not listed
2013-12-05 08:56:03	jormo	i mean it's fairly obvious what they do, but i want to see the official spec
2013-12-05 08:56:22	jormo	arguments, return values, etc... and other such functions
2013-12-05 08:56:22	Varun_Krishna	just a minute

2013-12-05 08:56:56	jormo	i thought that was referring to <input>
2013-12-05 08:57:05	jormo	not the global input() function

2013-12-05 08:57:55	jormo	what arguments do they take?
2013-12-05 08:58:07	Varun_Krishna	did you mean this input('query').enter('tablet');?
2013-12-05 08:58:30	jormo	yes, and select(...) and repeater(...)

2013-12-06 15:00:08	dariocravero	hi everyone, quick question... do anyone know if there were any changes in Google Chrome that may make the HTML5 mode for URLs fail? All of the sudden in v32 of Chrome I started getting all URLs prefixed by hashbangs which up until a couple of days weren't at all!
2013-12-06 15:00:44	dariocravero	the same applications running on Safari or Firefox work just fine
2013-12-06 15:01:23	oller	dariocravero: maybe try chrome canary

2013-12-06 15:03:22	oller	seems an odd one i'd maybe try chrome on another machine, see if it's a problem just with your browser

2013-12-06 15:05:51	oller	directive calls itself an incremental number of times, so pretty sure the watch is adding a watcher each time?
2013-12-06 15:07:21	oller	haven't plugged it all in, just posted the directive in case it's an obvious catch,
2013-12-06 15:07:32	caitp	the buttonRegister directive doesn't eem to call itself an incremental number of times
2013-12-06 15:07:37	caitp	but each instance of it would add a $watch, yes
2013-12-06 15:07:47	dariocravero	oller: caitp: disabling all plugins did it, will double check the ones I had installed then... thx again!
2013-12-06 15:08:07	oller	so as it stands i have just one button, present

2013-12-06 15:10:45	Roots47	Hey guys, is there anything special to know about using ng-model with checkboxes? For some reason when I set ng-model="myCheckbox" -- $scope.myCheckbox is always false in the controller regardless of whether or not the input is checked.

2013-12-06 15:30:39	michaellynch	So i asked this yesterday and never had anyone respond with pointers or ideas.  But what i am trying to accomplish is build a single application (angular front end that makes api calls to a rails backend) that can be deployed for several (10+) customers.  However each customer will need a seperate theme for thier deployment.  Any ideas of how to do this in Angular?
2013-12-06 15:30:41	dariocravero	michaellynch: morning :)

2013-12-06 15:31:11	dariocravero	michaellynch: by theme you mean look and feel?
2013-12-06 15:31:15	michaellynch	yea
2013-12-06 15:31:55	michaellynch	Basically the CSS File i need to include would be something like "/styles/{{themename}}/style.css" or something like that.
2013-12-06 15:32:23	dariocravero	I reckon it might be a better fit to address that from your Rails app

2013-12-06 15:33:38	dariocravero	so you do exactly that, in which themename is an variable/helper available to your views depending on the user/client (if you're sharing the instance across all of them otherwise it's a setting somewhere)
2013-12-06 15:33:39	michaellynch	Well, the rails app will store what style is currently in use.  And then the Angular would make an API call getting that.  But it seems like that needs to happen is prior to even loading angular

2013-12-06 15:34:13	dariocravero	well, you could wait until angular has loaded and then insert your css but the UX will be very bad

2013-12-06 15:35:02	dariocravero	michaellynch: what's the problem with doing it from the Rails app?

2013-12-06 17:22:45	joepie91_	at least, it does now
2013-12-06 17:22:58	joepie91_	it was originally meant as a sort of joke on the dutch idiom that "you should have a manual"
2013-12-06 17:23:01	s3shs	Maybe we need #angular-prolific for joepie91_ .
2013-12-06 17:23:03	joepie91_	then it turned out to actually be useful

2013-12-06 17:27:20	s3shs	I thought the point of routers is they don't reload the page but rather switch you to another view.  Reloading the page is reloading the app.
2013-12-06 17:27:46	s3shs	But beyond that, I usually have to sacrifice a goat every time I futz with my router.

2013-12-06 17:30:41	caitp	https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/directive/input.js#L394 this gets called

2013-12-08 21:51:23	-->	petey has joined #angularjs

2013-12-08 21:58:51	golot7	I tried something similar, and I thought maybe it has to be something with the scope of the function.
2013-12-08 21:59:00	golot7	let me try it again
2013-12-08 21:59:16	golot7	I'll let you know in a few minutes, thanks for the help!
2013-12-08 21:59:32	wafflejock	golot7: it depends on how you "share" the data with the controller and make it in scope, you can utilize a service to do this or a value... np if you get stuck see if you can reproduce in a plunkr or jsfiddle, helps us help
2013-12-08 21:59:47	caitp-	i think that assumes elasticsearch returns a promise

2013-12-08 22:08:44	wafflejock	basically it just deals with the common use cases for a asynch request, you ask for something then it either works or it doesn't, in the case that it  works it will essentially call your success funtion if it errors it will call your error function... there's a bit more to it but that's the basics
2013-12-08 22:08:55	caitp-	anyways, http://docs.fullscale.co/elasticjs/ejs.Request.html#ejs.Request.doSearch ... you should use the success and error callbacks
2013-12-08 22:09:04	caitp-	to preprocess data and populate your scope

2013-12-08 22:12:24	wafflejock	Slade-: yes
2013-12-08 22:12:39	caitp-	any time you have an angular-powered form on your page you have lots of controllers

2013-12-08 22:39:20	wafflejock	chanced: yeah ultimately it's a good setup... I come from a Flex/AS3 background so in there you wrote XML they called MXML that was then translated into AS3 code... so it could all be written in AS3 in theory but the XML format for making layouts just makes things a lot easier... so I like that mentality in AngularJS too, using HTML as the layout

2013-12-08 23:05:58	wafflejock	n008: angular will handle creating that controller anytime it's using that template, it runs through compile which will find all the directives then calls the link function on each passing it the scope or creating scopes where necessary
2013-12-08 23:06:34	n008	BahamutWC: with $routeProvider, I use resolve, but I am not using the controller via $routeProvider

2013-12-08 23:10:15	s3shs	Ahh, so grunt is basically 'make' without suckle.

2013-12-08 23:11:39	wafflejock	n008: yeah it's one way... if you don't need to manipulate the data in the controller and just want to share it from the service it's a bit cleaner

I'd also like to have an additional class based on a condition (if $scope.activeInput === elem.name, then it should have an "active" class).  How do I merge that array with a condition?

2013-12-09 16:51:03	wafflejock	otherwise you use $scope.$watch in the controller to watch for changes on the service and do something to the local scope, or else you use promises from the service and return them to the controller

2013-12-09 16:53:22	wafflejock	^ just a guess
2013-12-09 16:53:23	yoshokatana	ah, yeah what wafflejock said
2013-12-09 16:53:37	yoshokatana	checkboxes/radio buttons are weird
2013-12-09 16:53:43	wafflejock	b52: yeah that's how I've done it and has worked out pretty well

2013-12-09 16:54:09	yoshokatana	anyone know how to add an id to a transcluded element in the transclude function?

2013-12-09 16:55:21	volk_	hey guys, when you do an '&' on the scope field in a directive, does that essentially allow you to execute only whats inside that particular hash in the parent context, do all the other attributes get stomped ? so if I have an id="{{ something.some}}" and it doesn't get specifically listed in ??that scope field, it seems to become undefined.
2013-12-09 16:55:29	derhasi	wafflejock: is angular.copy() doing the magic in your plunker, or is it just about "sharing data without triggering events"?

2013-12-09 16:56:12	wafflejock	derhasi: angular.copy replaces the properties of an object or the elements of an array without replacing the initial element, so yeah it's a big part of the "magic" :)

2013-12-09 17:03:26	Guest83970	gatoralli: I haven't addressed this within karma runs, but the error notifier I wrote for Rackspace translates backtraces by using sourcemaps.

2013-12-12 18:09:47	caitp	Roots47 there's no way for an interpolated expression to give you an object
2013-12-12 18:10:03	caitp	you can _not_ use interpolation, and get an object (maybe) with $parse(expr)(scope)
2013-12-12 18:10:49	Roots47	caitp: Can I do something like ng-click="{{scopeVar = item}}"

2013-12-12 18:13:37	tpyo	the elements exist

2013-12-12 18:15:10	tpyo	but I guess its something else
2013-12-12 18:15:27	yoshokatana	it was something about putting display: block on one of the interstitial classes if I recall correctly

2013-12-22 15:06:00	Foxandxss	you're accessing the controller's scope there
2013-12-22 15:06:00	Foxandxss	that is why ng-repeat doesn't work
2013-12-22 15:06:00	Efrem	zumba_addict unless I'm missing something you've got your controller defined but not added to the app. Does this code run with no errors in your console?
2013-12-22 15:06:10	Foxandxss	because it doesn't find the object
2013-12-22 15:06:20	kaan	so i need to pass it to a controller right?

2013-12-22 15:22:47	Efrem	That's probably where your issue lies then :-)

2013-12-22 15:26:08	zumba_addict	Once I create a real rest service, I would have to return a format like this
2013-12-22 15:26:34	zumba_addict	what would be one nice api that implements rest service easily? I'm not familiar with java
2013-12-22 15:27:04	Efrem	I don't know java either, if you are looking for java spefically I've got nothing for you, sorry

2013-12-22 16:07:34	zumba_addict	hey guys, do you think this kind of form is efficient? It's in a single modal window but 3 steps. The form is used to create a device. First step is it asks the name that you want to give to the device. You click next and you are shown with type of device like a phone, a printer or a monitor and you pick the type you want. You click next and you are now allowed to choose settings and you finally click Submit.

2013-12-27 17:31:06	tdierks	hashpuppy, yes, it's an ordering issue. I can't even find the other log, and I can't really figure out what's needed by your code. I think that if you want to communicate between these components, can't you set up the service at construction time so it will be ready at the time the dependent services are constructed?
2013-12-27 17:31:15	aras7	yes, I did. but how must I do it in 1.2?
2013-12-27 17:31:17	tdierks	RIght now you're dependent on the construction order of peer services.

2013-12-27 17:39:38	hashpuppy	oh, no worries.  thanks for looking, though.  i'll play around some more.  quick_repeat_list gets injected from angular.module('QuickList').value('quickRepeatList', {});
2013-12-27 17:39:49	tdierks	hashpuppy: in your demo, which I forked here: http://plnkr.co/edit/yqzb1jQsSx3RW93ToeN9?p=preview
2013-12-27 17:40:42	hashpuppy	tdierks: oh cool.  thanks.  let me look at that solution.  i see the console.log printed what i wanted
2013-12-27 17:40:44	tdierks	I would suggest either initializing QuickList with the necessary field win the injection, such as I've now donw.
2013-12-27 17:40:56	tdierks	Sorry, I just edited it.
2013-12-27 17:41:21	tdierks	That's if you need to set up a precondition, like initializing a function.
2013-12-27 17:41:47	tdierks	If you just need to watch data being set into the service by other dependents (like in this example), you don't need to worry, you can just do it lazily.

2013-12-27 18:41:17	tdierks	It's just an expression that evaluates both functions.
2013-12-27 18:41:50	tdierks	You might be able to use comma as well, would be better, but I didn't want to try it.
2013-12-27 18:42:19	tdierks	I'm not sure enough about how angular expression evaluation works to know if the comma operator will work within one.

2013-12-27 19:29:41	ffff	so it's not showing up in req.body.

2013-12-27 23:10:11	tdierks	RoryHughes, the attacker can't get access to the page content or headers with csrf token.
2013-12-27 23:10:12	-->	alx_ has joined #angularjs
2013-12-27 23:10:30	tdierks	Since attacker is running in a different domain security context.
2013-12-27 23:10:36	RoryHughes	tdierks: what if they have cors enabled?
2013-12-27 23:11:38	-->	waylon999 has joined #angularjs
2013-12-27 23:12:22	tdierks	You shouldn't send CSRF tokens in CORS-allowed responses (allowed to untrusted domains) or you're leaking them to untrusted attackers.

2013-12-27 23:15:06	RoryHughes	How does the app being attacked know if cors is enabled on the attacker site
2013-12-27 23:15:21	tdierks	It's not whether it's enabled on the attacker site.

2013-12-27 23:16:20	Ciartan	huhu :)
2013-12-27 23:16:29	tdierks	Your site gets a request from a logged-in user with cookie C. It then sends a reply that includes an XSRF token T, which is derived from C.
2013-12-27 23:16:33	Ciartan	someone awake? :)
2013-12-27 23:16:44	tdierks	For example, this would be when loading the app or similar.
2013-12-27 23:16:54	<--	Neozaru has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-27 23:17:10	tdierks	Then, the code in the app which knows T submits it along with a request that changes application state.
2013-12-27 23:17:17	-->	Neozaru has joined #angularjs
2013-12-27 23:17:27	tdierks	The server can verify that the T submitted is consistent with the user's session cookie C
2013-12-27 23:17:27	<--	wxo has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2013-12-27 23:17:35	tdierks	And if so, the request is valid.
2013-12-27 23:17:47	tdierks	This depends on not leaking T outside of your trusted code domain.
2013-12-27 23:18:04	tdierks	So don't allow internet-wide CORS requests on the service that serves T.

2013-12-28 17:18:24	BahamutWC	then I would modify the template so your child dom element uses a custom directive, and create a new directive for doing the behavior
2013-12-28 17:18:38	BahamutWC	and trigger the behavior via changes in $scope
2013-12-28 17:18:53	billy	cool, I'll try that

2013-12-28 17:21:16	BahamutWC	sometimes if you need to use 3rd party libraries though, creating your own directive with element.on('click', function() { ... }) is preferred though

2013-12-28 17:57:54	BahamutWC	ffff: $http({method: 'DELETE'})
2013-12-28 17:57:56	hashpuppy	I've read that ng-repeating on 500 "rows" with 10 "columns" of ng-binds will create 5000 watches.  And this is a problem because they all get iterated on in $digest to check for a change.  My question is why is $digest getting called for all 5000 watches since ng-repeat is supposed to create a new scope for each "row"?

2013-12-28 17:58:26	BahamutWC	want to say angular supports $http.delete, but not sure
2013-12-28 17:58:41	hashpuppy	or do the watchers get added to the root scope?
2013-12-28 17:58:44	BahamutWC	yep, angular does support $http.delete
2013-12-28 17:58:55	BahamutWC	http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http
2013-12-28 17:59:30	BahamutWC	hashpuppy: that is because for each $scope, angular has to determine whether there are any watchers associated with them
2013-12-28 17:59:57	BahamutWC	in this case, ng-bind creates a $watch
2013-12-28 18:00:15	BahamutWC	it watches for changes in the model value, and updates the DOM on change
2013-12-28 18:00:30	papepapes	hashpuppy: it will create 5001 watches
2013-12-28 18:00:37	papepapes	you forgot the ng-repeat

2013-12-28 19:01:44	teslan___	angularjs client and your database... so, you first need to do some mind adjusting and going from a classic php site to an ajax one ... hth

2013-12-28 19:02:50	BahamutWC	it is a bit fragile to work that way, and you need to establish conventions

2013-12-28 19:04:58	BahamutWC	mmitchell: Angular covers more for a site - with React, you're likely to pair it with other libraries to cover the same functionality
2013-12-28 19:05:02	CodeFriar	dino_: you'd end up using PHP as a api  layer between your angular application, and your db
2013-12-28 19:05:12	BahamutWC	if you want a smaller library, React is probably not a bad choice to use
2013-12-28 19:05:27	BahamutWC	Angular requires a frontend to be architected around it basically
2013-12-28 19:05:33	BahamutWC	you can use React with Angular if you like event

2013-12-28 19:05:57	teslan___	dino_: so while there may be no database integration in most of the ui related demos and examples, you should most likely look at any examples related to the HTTP directive
2013-12-28 19:06:01	dino_	it's fantastic have all in a page
2013-12-28 19:06:02	BahamutWC	but it's sort of mixed concerns, since a large part of Angular revolves around directives, and their hooks into its controllers and such
2013-12-28 19:06:10	BahamutWC	mmitchell: I believe so
2013-12-28 19:06:18	mmitchell	Ahh OK

2013-12-28 19:06:30	BahamutWC	mmitchell: it is a library for making reusable components as you seem to want, but it doesn't do as much for you
2013-12-28 19:06:37	BahamutWC	sort of like Backbone in a way
2013-12-28 19:07:08	CodeFriar	BahamutWC: not sure who to tell, but the issue is the minified version of 0.2.7 is borked.
2013-12-28 19:07:11	dino_	I don't know Backbone
2013-12-28 19:07:36	BahamutWC	CodeFriar: can you try reproducing your issue in plnkr?
2013-12-28 19:07:38	caitp	react doesn't really solve the same problems angular does
2013-12-28 19:07:42	caitp	it's more like brick
2013-12-28 19:07:49	mmitchell	BahamutWC: Thanks for the feedback.
2013-12-28 19:07:51	BahamutWC	that might give insight into your problem
2013-12-28 19:07:59	caitp	it's a web component framework

2013-12-28 19:08:17	BahamutWC	I've seen 0.2.7 work fine for the most part though, so I highly suspect it's a more simple error in your angular code

2013-12-28 19:09:08	BahamutWC	caitp: I think it sort of treads in Angular's ground some though, since directives are meant for components as well

2013-12-28 19:09:38	caitp	directives are similar to components, but that's just one small part of angular
2013-12-28 19:09:41	CodeFriar	BahamutWC: unminified version works fine. no change but to take out .min from file name
2013-12-28 19:09:44	BahamutWC	right
2013-12-28 19:10:02	caitp	the "source of truth" and keeping javascript data synced with what is shown in the view is angular's thing
2013-12-28 19:10:06	caitp	react doesn't really have a way to do that
2013-12-28 19:10:07	BahamutWC	CodeFriar: maybe the minified version is borked then - maybe open an issue in the repo?
2013-12-28 19:10:14	caitp	not built in, anyway

2013-12-28 19:15:44	teslan___	BahamutWC: so what are those templates or rather what do they contain that helps with reducing number of hits for what ... there's just one html file, lots of js files (is it packaging of them) and lots of data related hits which are mostly user determined and driven ?

2013-12-28 21:43:42	Foxandxss	but tricks are tricks
2013-12-28 21:44:00	pkozlowski_os	so not everything is beautiful and we didn't start to use AngularJS 1.2 tricks
2013-12-28 21:44:01	Foxandxss	learnt good stuff about testing and some directive tricks
2013-12-28 21:44:25	Foxandxss	pkozlowski_os: yeah, but still a lot of stuff to learn from

2013-12-28 21:45:10	Foxandxss	just a line of code
2013-12-28 21:45:22	Foxandxss	that seems that it wasn't for a test that is not anymore there
2013-12-28 21:45:26	pkozlowski_os	and hey, be sure to contribute back to the project after your learning experience is over :-)
2013-12-28 21:45:29	Foxandxss	good, Ill clone last version and test that myself

2013-12-28 23:25:14	wolfman2000	I actually look forward to some of that. The only problem is that I don't really have a good project to use c++11 on.
2013-12-28 23:25:23	caitp	trying to write a little DI module for native code, just to see if I can, and it seems like C++11 functional stuff could make it a bit more elegant/natural, but it's very awkward compared to classic C++

2014-01-15 11:57:37	robdubya	sgronblo no, because he's looping over an array of categories
2014-01-15 11:57:38	chakkimatti	robdubya:  so the only way to make the active state recognition work is by ng-repeat?
2014-01-15 11:57:52	sgronblo	I started doing Angular about 4 days ago myself
2014-01-15 11:57:55	robdubya	no, you can do it the way you keep doing it, but its a shitload of extra work
2014-01-15 11:58:11	robdubya	chakkimatti ^
2014-01-15 11:58:49	chakkimatti	so, for the sake of learning. How would I go about to make it work this way?

2014-01-15 11:59:26	robdubya	chakkimatti {active : active == 'events' } that's the important bit on the active thing
2014-01-15 11:59:36	loostro	that are in category.products

2014-01-15 11:59:51	sgronblo	I think it might make sense to put the data in a more appropriate format instead of trying to piece it together in the view?
2014-01-15 11:59:58	robdubya	so as long as somewhere in your scope, you have $scope.active = 'event'
2014-01-15 11:59:59	loostro	well.. they're not really there.. i mean, those that have names in category.products
2014-01-15 12:00:26	Keika	bd-: Thanks mate, that was exactly what I needed
2014-01-15 12:00:36	loostro	i have no control over the data format from backend
2014-01-15 12:00:52	Keika	just added a simple line on the response and it works fine, you da best!
2014-01-15 12:00:59	loostro	and refactoring it to diffrent schema is not really the best idea
2014-01-15 12:00:59	vshjxyz	Hi, I need to reformat a value in my scope with a directive, but I can't figure out how to properly link the value to the directive, with $watch it works, but I don't think/know if it's the best way to do it
2014-01-15 12:01:10	chakkimatti	robdubya:  I actually think I got it.. But for some reason it changes the active state on the Second time I click the button :(

2014-01-15 12:01:25	robdubya	chakkimatti its because you're checking a primitive
2014-01-15 12:01:35	loostro	this actually should be a simple task "hey, get me a plan for "productName".. why is it so hard in angular?
2014-01-15 12:01:35	vshjxyz	Also, in the link function I still see the pre-valorized value (in my case is {{ cart.total }})
2014-01-15 12:01:39	robdubya	so instead of setting scope.active = 'foo'
2014-01-15 12:01:48	robdubya	set scope.active = {name : 'foo'}
2014-01-15 12:02:03	chakkimatti	robdubya:  oh but I am a primitive... :D
2014-01-15 12:02:27	robdubya	then in the template check {active : active.name == 'foo'}
