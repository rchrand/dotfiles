2013-11-11 18:33:27	@chance	Datsundere: well they kind of do the same thing
2013-11-11 18:33:31	@chance	the thing is .sort() is a method
2013-11-11 18:33:33	@chance	and it returns None
2013-11-11 18:33:48	Datsundere	but internally the parameters passed are the list
2013-11-11 18:33:49	@chance	sorted() returns a copy of the list you passed it, sorted
2013-11-11 18:34:05	jordan888	sorted is only on py 3.0+ correct?
2013-11-11 18:34:08	@chance	the problem is when you try this: lst = [1,3,2]; list = list.sort()
2013-11-11 18:34:18	@chance	jordan888: sorted() is in 2.6+ at least.
2013-11-11 18:34:38	@chance	in my example `list` would be `None`
2013-11-11 18:34:42	jordan888	why does .sort() return None?
2013-11-11 18:34:43	@chance	and its very easy to make that mistake
2013-11-11 18:34:49	@chance	jordan888: because it doesnt return anything
2013-11-11 18:35:01	@chance	because it sorts the object in place, so it wouldnt need to return the value

2013-11-11 19:25:16	jordan888	ok. so if a loop exists, how does that translate into big O notation?
2013-11-11 19:25:52	jordan888	for example, from the code i pasted before, what steps do i take to determine the big o eq
2013-11-11 19:26:12	<--	gyaretto has quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
2013-11-11 19:26:21	@chance	basically big O is a very non specific *approximation* of efficiency
2013-11-11 19:26:27	@chance	so imagine you have a list
2013-11-11 19:26:44	@chance	a function which loops through it once would be O(x) where x is the size of the list
2013-11-11 19:27:24	@chance	O(x) meaning, the efficieny is O of x, where x is linear
2013-11-11 19:27:46	@chance	everytime the list gets bigger, your loop will also get longer, making it scale linearly
2013-11-11 19:28:33	@chance	if you have a loop inside another loop, depending on the 2nd loops conditions, its typically O(x^2) because for every item in the list it loops through it twice
2013-11-11 19:28:37	DevilFish	Well, not only will it get bigger, but it will get bigger as a constant factor times the number of elements.
2013-11-11 19:28:44	@chance	so you loop through the list x square times
2013-11-11 19:28:54	@chance	yeah.
2013-11-11 19:29:03	-->	Cirus has joined #learnprogramming
2013-11-11 19:29:14	@chance	remember its all an approximation
2013-11-11 19:29:21	jordan888	right. I understand
2013-11-11 19:29:22	@chance	so what actually happens in the loop is mostly neglible
2013-11-11 19:30:29	@chance	so really, just think about it based on the input, and the number of times your iterating based on that input
2013-11-11 19:30:33	jordan888	So, if i reduce it from 2 loops to 1, It would be approx twice as fast as it was?
2013-11-11 19:30:41	@chance	more than twice as fast
2013-11-11 19:30:53	@chance	way more
2013-11-11 19:31:04	jordan888	Ok.
2013-11-11 19:31:19	@chance	think of an exponential function
2013-11-11 19:31:21	@chance	and a linear function
2013-11-11 19:31:23	@chance	in math terms
2013-11-11 19:31:27	@chance	and how they look in a graph
2013-11-11 19:31:36	@chance	early on their both decently low values
2013-11-11 19:32:01	@chance	but once the values on the x axis are decently high, the exponential function grows really fast, and the linear one is growing as fast as it was at the beginning
2013-11-11 19:32:42	@chance	big O isn't a measure of when inputs are low, its based on the assumption that you're values are large enough for other things to not matter
2013-11-11 19:32:47	@chance	in scale
2013-11-11 19:32:54	@chance	so pretend your input is infinity
2013-11-11 19:33:18	jordan888	if the input was being reduced as the loop continues, this would be logarithmic ?

2013-11-11 19:34:48	@chance	yeah

2013-11-11 19:35:01	@chance	or whatever is making the variability of the functionj
2013-11-11 19:35:19	jordan888	ok yeah
2013-11-11 19:35:56	DevilFish	In general, you should worry about the actual performance rather than the theoretical performance.
2013-11-11 19:36:04	DevilFish	Because they can be very different.
2013-11-11 19:36:12	@chance	yeah
2013-11-11 19:36:18	@chance	if your inputs never get very large
2013-11-11 19:36:21	@chance	then its neglible
2013-11-11 19:36:27	jordan888	it seems like big O is more effective when dealing with large inputs
2013-11-11 19:36:31	@chance	yeah
2013-11-11 19:36:37	@chance	thats exactly what big O is about
2013-11-11 19:37:02	DevilFish	Big O also drops the constant factors, which is VERY important in real-world usage.
2013-11-11 19:37:03	jordan888	approx become more accurate as constants make no difference in performance
2013-11-11 19:37:03	@chance	its about efficiency when you scale the problem up
2013-11-11 19:37:20	@chance	so when you scale a problem up, arithematic is very small in the total time of computation
2013-11-11 19:37:25	@chance	for example

2013-11-11 19:45:10	@chance	move any computations that can be done outside loops to outside loops
2013-11-11 19:45:36	@chance	ie: it doesnt depend on the current state of the inner most loop, then dont waste CPU by calculating it each iteration

2013-11-11 19:50:16	@chance	hashing : well its like that in most languages, generators: python specific, you just learn over time python has two ways to iterate, on lists in memory, or dynamically generating the values you need when you need them (less memory consumption)
2013-11-11 19:50:36	@chance	length is just something i learned sometime ago reading the python source and learning more about intenrals

2013-11-11 19:51:54	@chance	dicts require computing a hash from the key to get the value, which isnt horrible, but if you do it a a ton it will add up

2013-11-11 20:00:07	DevilFish	jordan888, recursion can be turned into iteration, which is how most compilers for functional languages will try to do it.
2013-11-11 20:00:13	@chance	yeah.
2013-11-11 20:00:27	DevilFish	Modern CPUs are designed to iterate really fast
2013-11-11 20:01:44	jordan888	but loops are also iteration right?
2013-11-11 20:01:54	DevilFish	yes.
2013-11-11 20:02:40	@chance	its just in most non functional languages, recursion isnt optimized that way
2013-11-11 20:02:56	@chance	and it's less efficient because it ends up being a large stack of function calls
2013-11-11 20:03:29	DevilFish	Unless you have a pretty amazing compiler. GCC will try to do that, for instance. Interpreted languages as a rule don't apply heavy optimizations like that.
2013-11-11 20:03:42	@chance	in functional languages things like tail recursion help this

2013-11-11 20:04:56	Amadiro	CPUs aren't really that good at loops though, after all, that's why the compiler tries to unroll them if it can
2013-11-11 20:05:20	Amadiro	after all, a loop (that is not optimized in some way) involves a branch, and CPUs are bad at branches
2013-11-11 20:05:52	DevilFish	Amadiro, better than function calls, especially with good branch prediction.
2013-11-11 20:06:00	Amadiro	(not as bad as on e.g. GPUs, of course, where especially older models are horribly bad with branches)
2013-11-11 20:06:03	jordan888	i remember something about memoization reducing those branches
2013-11-11 20:06:30	DevilFish	yeah, GPUs aren't terribly good at general computation though.
2013-11-11 20:06:33	Amadiro	DevilFish, yeah, but if you can unroll a loop into a flat pipe of just straight-up mathematical operations, you'd prefer that
2013-11-11 20:06:39	jordan888	like with a Fibonacci sequence
2013-11-11 20:06:39	DevilFish	Amadiro, sure.

2013-11-11 20:28:06	@chance	heres something you'll find interesting
2013-11-11 20:28:25	@chance	an array variable is not an array, it is the address of the first element of the array

2013-11-11 20:29:10	@chance	so when you pass an array to a function

2013-11-11 20:53:20	@chance	interesting
2013-11-11 20:53:32	mr_magpie	I'd have to add temp = string[index] in the body, right?
2013-11-11 20:53:44	jesyspa	I'd just not bother with temp and use string[index] everywhere.
2013-11-11 20:53:47	@chance	i assumed it *was* a pointer, but rather the variable assignmnent is a little magic
2013-11-11 20:53:55	jesyspa	Or go through the string with a pointer.
2013-11-11 20:54:08	jesyspa	And stop treating C++ like it's C.
2013-11-11 20:54:17	jesyspa	There's no need to declare everything at the top of the function.
2013-11-11 20:54:21	mr_magpie	I'm unfamiliar with pointers, and I know nothing of C.
2013-11-11 20:54:37	raylu	jesyspa: that's not a c++ or a c thing
2013-11-11 20:54:41	raylu	that's just an old compiler thing
2013-11-11 20:54:58	raylu	i guess c oldhats are older than c++ oldhats, but still
2013-11-11 20:55:16	jesyspa	Eh, it was a language rule in C89.
2013-11-11 20:55:32	raylu	i think it was just a guideline...
2013-11-11 20:55:40	@chance	declaring everything at the top doesnt hurt because then you dont have type declarations in the middle of your function
2013-11-11 20:55:55	@chance	i like dealing with types early, and then just worrying about assignment from then on
2013-11-11 20:55:55	raylu	instead, you have to move your eyes back up to figure out what the type of something is
2013-11-11 20:55:58	jesyspa	No, try compiling with gcc in strict C89 mode, it'll complain.
2013-11-11 20:56:06	raylu	with a warning?
2013-11-11 20:56:28	jesyspa	And declaring everything at the top means you end up with uninitialised or poorly initialised values all over the place.
2013-11-11 20:56:46	@chance	not necessarily
2013-11-11 20:57:02	@chance	that isnt restricted to declaration at the top
2013-11-11 20:57:07	@chance	you could do exactly that in the middle of a function
2013-11-11 20:57:15	@chance	they aren't mutually exclusive
2013-11-11 20:57:22	raylu	yeah, but it's less likely to happen in the middle
2013-11-11 20:57:27	@chance	no it isnt
2013-11-11 20:57:44	@chance	its only less likely if you initialize at the same time as declaration, because then you can't have it any other way
2013-11-11 20:57:47	jesyspa	It can happen otherwise, too, but you force it in cases when you otherwise wouldn't have to when you force declarations at the top.
2013-11-11 20:57:49	raylu	because if you change the first time you use something you now also need to move the declaration
2013-11-11 20:57:51	@chance	whcih you could do at the top
2013-11-11 20:57:52	jesyspa	And it means you can use significantly less const.
2013-11-11 20:58:05	raylu	well, yes. that's what i mean: initialize at the same time as declaration
2013-11-11 20:58:09	raylu	which you can't always do at the top
2013-11-11 20:58:17	raylu	since you may need to initialize one variable based on another
2013-11-11 20:58:17	@chance	you can
2013-11-11 20:58:23	@chance	just find a reasonable default
2013-11-11 20:58:28	tangentstorm	less const == mo money.
2013-11-11 20:58:31	@chance	that doesnt depend on anything
2013-11-11 20:58:34	raylu	that seems worse than not initializing
2013-11-11 20:58:41	@chance	not really
2013-11-11 20:58:45	@chance	this is how go works
2013-11-11 20:58:55	raylu	since now you've assigned it something meaningless only to reassign the actual meaningful value later
2013-11-11 20:58:56	@chance	all values have an initialized 0 value after being created with new()
2013-11-11 20:59:22	@chance	i suppose thats slightly different, since its more like all structs have a default value
2013-11-11 20:59:27	@chance	rather than all values
2013-11-11 20:59:35	jesyspa	A "reasonable deafult" doesn't always exist.
2013-11-11 20:59:53	jesyspa	You could go for a boost::optional<T> instead of a T, of course, but that's just silly.
2013-11-11 21:00:05	@chance	thats true, in that case declare it later, but it doesn't mean you have to declare everything in the middle either
2013-11-11 21:00:12	jesyspa	And it means you break warnings about uninitialised use.
2013-11-11 21:00:14	@chance	its really arbitrary if your using best practices in either places.
2013-11-11 21:00:19	raylu	mr_magpie: anyway, your problem stems from the fact that for loops are just a little too magical
2013-11-11 21:00:30	jesyspa	So you declare things when you need them, simple.
2013-11-11 21:00:31	raylu	my usual advice in these situations is to rewrite your (second) for loop as a while loop
2013-11-11 21:02:28	mr_magpie	I'm struggling to get my toupper to work :P
2013-11-11 21:02:38	mr_magpie	Once I get that working, I'll write another loop.
2013-11-11 21:03:02	raylu	you're struggling to get std::toupper or StrToUpper?
2013-11-11 21:03:11	jesyspa	raylu, Okay, we're half-right: you are allowed declarations only at the beginning of compound statements in C89.
2013-11-11 21:03:24	raylu	actually, what is this function supposed to do anyway?
2013-11-11 21:03:27	jesyspa	So they may be in the middle of a function, but far from "anywhere".
2013-11-11 21:03:39	mr_magpie	Both since toupper is within StrToUpper, but I realized that the std::toupper isn't even changing the case.
2013-11-11 21:03:51	mr_magpie	It's supposed to take a string and make it all uppercase.
2013-11-11 21:03:56	mr_magpie	Then return true if successful.
2013-11-11 21:04:02	raylu	when would it ever not be successful?
2013-11-11 21:04:18	mr_magpie	Well, the string has to be only alphabetic characters.
2013-11-11 21:04:21	mr_magpie	No numbers.
2013-11-11 21:04:36	raylu	i see... why have 2 loops, then?
2013-11-11 21:04:47	jesyspa	mr_magpie, toupper doesn't change things in-place, IIRC, it returns the uppercase value.
2013-11-11 21:04:56	@chance	i guess another reason I do declaration at the top is we are required to do so in my OS clsas
2013-11-11 21:04:58	@chance	class
2013-11-11 21:05:08	@chance	i didnt even realize but apparently thats how its done in most of the kernel
2013-11-11 21:05:08	mr_magpie	The first was to try to change the case, the second was to check for numbers.
2013-11-11 21:05:28	mr_magpie	jesyspa: is this true? So I'll have to use an assignment.
2013-11-11 21:05:29	raylu	why not check for numbers before changing the case?
2013-11-11 21:05:44	mr_magpie	I guess I shouldnt probably do that.
2013-11-11 21:06:16	raylu	then again, if your string is abc1xyz, i expect strtoupper to not do anything rather than return false and mutate my string to ABC1xyz
2013-11-11 21:06:37	raylu	THEN AGAIN, i really just expect ABC1XYZ

2013-11-11 21:22:45	raylu	i only had you write it as a while loop to make it less confusing
2013-11-11 21:22:45	tangentstorm	wax on, wax off
2013-11-11 21:23:50	jesyspa	mr_magpie, Have you already covered classes?
2013-11-11 21:24:16	mr_magpie	I don't believe so.
2013-11-11 21:24:36	jesyspa	Then stop wasting your time with figuring out how arrays are passed around and learn those.
2013-11-11 21:24:52	jesyspa	Far more useful, and once you know them, you'll be able to deal with C string properly.
2013-11-11 21:25:21	jesyspa	Including seeing stuff you can't be exposed to yet, like how they (when dynamically allocated) interact with exceptions.
2013-11-11 21:25:47	jesyspa	Right now you're just writing sloppy code; you're not even checking for overflow.
2013-11-11 21:26:24	mr_magpie	omg I got my toupper to work as I'm being scolded
2013-11-11 21:26:43	mr_magpie	jesyspa: you can't expect me to start perfectly can you?
2013-11-11 21:27:14	raylu	no, but until it's perfect you'll be scolded anyway ;)
2013-11-11 21:27:24	mr_magpie	I mean, I'm making progress. I was learning how to write a string literal like just a month ago.
2013-11-11 21:27:28	mr_magpie	I understand :P
2013-11-11 21:27:58	jesyspa	If I expected you to be perfect, there wouldn't be much point pointing out you're wasting your time.
2013-11-11 21:28:25	mr_magpie	Well, maybe not perfect, but much higher than reasonable :|

2013-11-12 14:14:25	ophuk	When creating databases should you create the tables with all the constraints in place right away or create the tables, add the data, then add the constraints?
2013-11-12 14:18:50	tangentstorm	it depends whether or not you have circular dependencies
2013-11-12 14:19:34	tangentstorm	also what tool you're using.
2013-11-12 14:21:49	tangentstorm	ophuk: i think normally it would be better to have all the constraints up front... but like i have a database where that's not possible.
2013-11-12 14:22:51	tangentstorm	i have a set of tables that model arbitrary trees, where each node is typed... and then i have a type system... and that type system is also a tree, and there are a set of prebuilt types that need to be there to bootstrap everythnig.
2013-11-12 14:23:22	ophuk	tangentstorm: The reason I ask is because I have a homework assignment where you can't create all the tables without excluding foreign keys in one table and adding it at the end. Then you can't add any data once that's done and it just seems backwards to me.
2013-11-12 14:23:23	tangentstorm	but that's pretty unusual.
2013-11-12 14:24:07	ophuk	and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. I could create the tables, add in the data, then add in the constraints since it is small and I can verify it but that seems counter productive and that what databases were made for
2013-11-12 14:24:14	ophuk	yeah it's ridiculous:/
2013-11-12 14:24:31	tangentstorm	ophuk: ... weird. do you have a copy of the schema or the assignment online somewhere?
2013-11-12 14:24:49	-->	Lancien has joined #learnprogramming
2013-11-12 14:25:07	ophuk	yeah...give me a sec. Personally I think the entire thing is wrong
2013-11-12 14:26:53	ophuk	tangentstorm: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3kgqczc5r6ia5xe/Key%20to%20Assignment2.jpg
2013-11-12 14:26:53	tamper	ophuk's url: http://bit.ly/1cLqjmR
2013-11-12 14:26:57	ophuk	so that's the answer to the last assignment we had and the schema the database is built off of
2013-11-12 14:27:44	ophuk	tangentstorm: I have two more pictures of the data but the data pictures only show PK if you'd like to see them
2013-11-12 14:29:41	tangentstorm	the issue is with the superssn field?
2013-11-12 14:31:24	ophuk	tangentstorm: http://pastebin.com/mbNjVVqE That's the error I get when I add something to the employee field. If you'd like I can show the script I have to create the tables
2013-11-12 14:31:30	tangentstorm	ophuk: that's the only loop i see... if that's your problem, you shouldn't need to break referential integrity to populate this schema. you just have to insert the ceo first.
2013-11-12 14:32:11	ophuk	tangentstorm: hmm...let me try that then
2013-11-12 14:32:13	tangentstorm	(because presumably the ceo is his own boss)
2013-11-12 14:32:29	tangentstorm	or her.
2013-11-12 14:33:47	ophuk	tangentstorm: actually it's null:/
2013-11-12 14:34:05	tangentstorm	well try making it not null.
2013-11-12 14:34:16	tangentstorm	or, add that one record and then add the constraints.
2013-11-12 14:34:25	ophuk	which was another question I had just hadn't gotten there yet...I didn't think FK could be null
2013-11-12 14:34:33	tangentstorm	it can't
2013-11-12 14:34:35	tangentstorm	but
2013-11-12 14:35:02	tangentstorm	if you want a 1 to [0..1] relationship then you can do that.
2013-11-12 14:35:51	tangentstorm	you just make a 1 to many relationship but then make the column on the 'many' side unique.
2013-11-12 14:36:44	ophuk	hmm....I'll just create the tables then add the constraints in for now to do these queries for this assignment. I've also asked my professor because I want to say project violates 3NF as well, mgrstartdate is based off mgrssn and then the primary key
2013-11-12 14:38:35	tangentstorm	so...  create table person (id integer not null primary key); create table boss_of (employee integer references person, boss integer references person) ... plus add a constraint so that employee is unique.
2013-11-12 14:39:52	tangentstorm	ophuk: why do you say project violates 3nf?
2013-11-12 14:40:47	ophuk	In the table department mgrstartdate is depenedent on mgrssn which isn't a PK
2013-11-12 14:41:02	ophuk	but I'm not a 100% positive on that one
2013-11-12 14:41:23	tangentstorm	oh i thought you meant the table called 'project' :)
2013-11-12 14:43:03	tangentstorm	i don't think it's dependent on mgrssn...
2013-11-12 14:44:01	tangentstorm	mgrssn is the ssn for the current manager (which i would never really use as a key, but... ok)
2013-11-12 14:44:51	tangentstorm	i would interpret mgrstartdate as the date when the department manager last changed.

2013-11-12 14:45:37	ophuk	tangentstorm: I think I did say project on accident. Yeah, maybe it's just me. I feel like it would be better in it's own table
2013-11-12 14:45:53	ophuk	you wouldn't use SSN as a key?
2013-11-12 14:46:03	tangentstorm	if you wanted to keep a history you could certainly have a separate table that logged the start and end date of each manager's "reign"
2013-11-12 14:46:06	tangentstorm	no
2013-11-12 14:46:15	tangentstorm	for several reasons.
2013-11-12 14:46:20	ophuk	tangentstorm: why's that?
2013-11-12 14:46:38	ophuk	tangentstorm: yeah...to me it would make sense to keep track of who was in charge and when
2013-11-12 14:46:39	tangentstorm	i would just use an arbitrary number
2013-11-12 14:47:04	tangentstorm	one is privacy...
2013-11-12 14:47:44	tangentstorm	but also some people have no social security number...
2013-11-12 14:48:26	tangentstorm	you might want to use a contracting company for which you have 10 people but only know 1 tax id.
2013-11-12 14:48:38	ophuk	tangentstorm: this is true...didn't think about htat
2013-11-12 14:48:51	tangentstorm	and also someone might just type the thing in wrong.

2013-11-12 20:07:40	digital-ghost	Hi all. What is the correct way to use the translation method in rspec tests? I had been using i18n.t('something.something') but was told the use of i18n. on each call wasn't very dry. So I tried 'require 'reails-i18n'' but this just throws errors.

2013-11-12 20:30:33	raylu	*can
2013-11-12 20:32:28	digital-ghost	raylu: The tests themselves shouldn't really matter. I'm simply looking for the correct way to use a translation method, instead of using static text that can be changed. This is a very brittle way to test, so if I use the translations from en.yml it's less likely to break if someone changes text.
2013-11-12 20:32:28	digital-ghost	There just doesn't seem to be any information out there on this topic.
2013-11-12 20:32:47	raylu	i can't tell what's not DRY about it without seeing the code
2013-11-12 20:33:03	raylu	i have no idea what you're testing or why you're even using i18n

2013-11-12 20:34:54	raylu	seems fine to me. you're not repeating yourself
2013-11-12 20:40:30	digital-ghost	raylu: Any idea why using 'require i18n' in the test file doesn't work?

2013-11-14 17:56:19	jesyspa	There is no simple way.
2013-11-14 17:56:44	jesyspa	The first thing that comes to mind is to read the line, and then use sscanf to get the numbers out of that.

2013-11-14 17:58:32	jesyspa	tangentstorm, IIRC, scanf treats all whitespace equally.
2013-11-14 17:59:07	tangentstorm	sebnil92: can you post you full program up to http://bpaste.net/ ?
2013-11-14 17:59:22	jesyspa	Or, preferably, to something that compiles and runs the code, like ideone.com
2013-11-14 17:59:33	tangentstorm	even better
2013-11-14 17:59:44	sebnil92	Seriously, it's about 4 rows. ^^

2013-11-14 18:00:04	jesyspa	That's three "rows" too many.

2013-11-14 18:03:06	tangentstorm	thanks :)
2013-11-14 18:03:36	jesyspa	And you want that to stop after the first newline?
2013-11-14 18:03:51	sebnil92	Yes, that was that i had in mind :)
2013-11-14 18:04:15	tangentstorm	sebnil92: this has nothing to do with your question, but the first thing that jumps out at me is this line: output=output+number;  ... you can and should just say : output += number;
2013-11-14 18:04:20	sebnil92	Now it just couninue to loop untill i put in something else than numbers. THEN it shows me the result.
2013-11-14 18:04:46	sebnil92	aah, a shortcut :)
2013-11-14 18:05:26	jesyspa	Well, I'm pretty sure scanf leaves trailing whitespace in the buffer, so you could just precede every read with a char-by-char read that accepts space and terminates on newline.
2013-11-14 18:07:58	sebnil92	Hmm.. I don't get that..
2013-11-14 18:08:52	sebnil92	The thing is that it break the loop and gives me the last printf with the sum - correctly
2013-11-14 18:08:54	jesyspa	Suppose the buffer is "52 34\n 44"
2013-11-14 18:09:18	jesyspa	The first scanf call will read 52 and then leave " 34\n 44" in the buffer.
2013-11-14 18:09:19	sebnil92	aah
2013-11-14 18:12:27	tangentstorm	sebnil92: if you're on a linux system, you can probably press ^D to end the input... ^Z on windows
2013-11-14 18:13:08	sebnil92	Yea,but that terminates the script and leave the last printf not printed.
2013-11-14 18:13:22	sebnil92	a dot or whatever makes it "working"
2013-11-14 18:13:50	tangentstorm	well then do what jesyspa says and manually read the buffer character by charater
2013-11-14 18:14:00	jesyspa	Closing the input stream should lead to the output still being performed...
2013-11-14 18:14:19	tangentstorm	that's kind of what i thought too, but i didn't try it yet
2013-11-14 18:17:20	tangentstorm	maybe something like this: { while ((char ch = getchar()) <= ' ') { if (ch == 13) return; }  ungetchar(); }
2013-11-14 18:18:51	jesyspa	Except of course you wouldn't actually use the literal 13 to indicate a newline.
2013-11-14 18:19:24	tangentstorm	'\n' ?
2013-11-14 18:19:29	jesyspa	Yes.
2013-11-14 18:19:41	tangentstorm	fair enough

2013-11-14 18:22:34	jesyspa	No, local search as in simulated annealing.

2013-11-14 18:36:38	tangentstorm	so instead of using scanf, which operates on stdin, you could use sscanf, which operates on a string.
2013-11-14 18:37:02	tangentstorm	you can use gets() to get a single line.

2013-11-14 20:03:16	Amadiro	exactly

2013-11-14 20:03:37	Amadiro	the type on the left-hand-side and on the right-hand-side are always the same
2013-11-14 20:03:43	Amadiro	because typeof() always returns a string
2013-11-14 20:03:44	jParkton	True;
2013-11-14 20:03:45	Amadiro	and "string" is a string
2013-11-14 20:03:55	Amadiro	so == or === (and != or !==) doesn't matter

2013-11-14 22:04:56	sssizzlesauce	for my class right now, i'm having to ssh my stuff to the schools server then open it in a browser
2013-11-14 22:04:57	sssizzlesauce	and its tedious

2013-11-14 22:07:20	sssizzlesauce	if there a quicker way than uploading it to the server
2013-11-14 22:07:25	@intothev01d	<?php echo 'test' ?>
2013-11-14 22:07:38	@intothev01d	put that in a page and go to it

2013-11-14 22:08:28	@intothev01d	also you'll need a ; at the end of that echo statement, mistyped
2013-11-14 22:09:46	@intothev01d	you can set up sublime text and probably some other editors and IDE to upload the saved file to the server when you save it

2013-11-14 22:10:44	@intothev01d	also you can check out Vagrant and set up a vm to test in if you want. plenty of options

2013-11-15 19:48:13	Aafter	Okay. So if child[inh] is referring to a spot in an array, I feel like the space would matter. That's the case in Java and Python.
2013-11-15 19:48:28	Aafter	But I have no idea about C++.
2013-11-15 19:48:50	ShredDurst	i think it might have too, i usually don't put that space there
2013-11-15 19:48:50	ShredDurst	but when ifixed it i got the same result
2013-11-15 19:49:05	Aafter	Gotcha.
2013-11-15 19:49:32	ShredDurst	but yeah, with the new breeding mechanics you can now pass down 5 ivs instead of 3 if one of the parents is holding a Destiny Knot
2013-11-15 19:50:01	Aafter	The Knot of Destiny. Ha.
2013-11-15 19:50:20	Aafter	But that's cool. I can't wait to play it.

2013-11-15 19:51:11	ShredDurst	and apparently the game decides which IVs are gonna be passed down after you accept or reject the previous egg
2013-11-15 19:51:11	ShredDurst	so what you do is save after you reject an egg, then pick up a new one, hatch it, and check its ivs
2013-11-15 19:51:11	ShredDurst	and that'll be the pattern of inheritence you get no matter what the parents are
2013-11-15 19:51:28	ShredDurst	so you can just swap out parents to get a child with the IVs you want
2013-11-15 19:51:35	ShredDurst	if you have the correct parents
2013-11-15 19:51:44	Aafter	Oh. That seems less random than before.
2013-11-15 19:51:57	ShredDurst	i want my program to suggest what parents to use given the original parents and the child
2013-11-15 19:52:32	Aafter	That's pretty cool.
2013-11-15 19:52:43	ShredDurst	and eventually i'd like to just read in a list of possible parents and then have the program select them for you
2013-11-15 19:53:10	ShredDurst	but for now i'm just working on making sure it correctly calculates the inheritence
2013-11-15 19:53:16	Aafter	Yeah.
2013-11-15 19:53:44	ShredDurst	it's a project a little farther beyond the scope of my abilities

2013-11-15 21:11:19	Aafter	So, I dont understand this or how to make this happen. Complete the solution so that it takes the object (JavaScript/CoffeeScript) or hash (ruby) passed in and generates a human readable string from its key/value pairs.  The format should be "KEY = VALUE". Each key/value pair should be separated by a comma except for the last pair.

2013-11-15 21:34:40	raylu	in git, `git diff`
2013-11-15 21:34:51	Left_Turn	ah thanks ray
2013-11-15 21:35:10	daphee	It's still really hard for me to figure out the Go way of doing things.
2013-11-15 21:36:37	raylu	daphee: you can definitely combine some of the code on lines 43-51

2013-11-15 22:44:40	lizzard888	yeah i just thought it would make it slower if i had to constantly define it in a loop
2013-11-15 22:44:51	lizzard888	but i guess that really doesn't matter in the bigger picture
2013-11-15 22:45:04	raylu	if anything, it makes it faster
2013-11-15 22:45:28	lizzard888	good to know.
2013-11-15 22:46:05	raylu	anyway, try running your code on a smaller string
2013-11-15 22:46:41	lizzard888	how much smaller?

2013-11-15 23:04:05	darkf	i dunno what's going on either
2013-11-15 23:04:05	darkf	"Compares two strings of k length for mismatches," you don't check this invariant
2013-11-15 23:04:18	raylu	well, he's passing in strings of that length so whatever
2013-11-15 23:04:25	raylu	checking in variants is for bad programmers :P
2013-11-15 23:04:38	darkf	no it's why they're shitty programmers
2013-11-15 23:04:45	darkf	- is that they don't
2013-11-15 23:05:05	raylu	i don't like doing extra unnecessary checks

2013-11-15 23:06:30	lizzard888	changed that
2013-11-15 23:06:40	raylu	i can read the code on each line; i don't know why this function exists
2013-11-15 23:07:08	darkf	and why do you disagree raylu
2013-11-15 23:08:06	raylu	void *a = NULL;
2013-11-15 23:08:17	raylu	if (a == NULL) a = malloc(32);
2013-11-15 23:08:42	raylu	checking things that you know to be true is just clutter
2013-11-15 23:08:52	raylu	he's not writing a library for other people to use
2013-11-15 23:08:58	raylu	it's a function just for this script
2013-11-15 23:09:36	darkf	wow ok
2013-11-15 23:09:43	darkf	so its ok to write functions that dont do what they say
2013-11-15 23:09:44	darkf	great
2013-11-15 23:10:02	raylu	it does what it says if you pass in two strings of k length
2013-11-15 23:10:08	raylu	if you don't, that's your problem
2013-11-15 23:10:12	raylu	just like all of libc
2013-11-15 23:10:20	darkf	this is python, not libc, jerk
2013-11-15 23:10:27	raylu	the same principle applies
2013-11-15 23:10:31	darkf	it does not
2013-11-15 23:10:36	darkf	C is wholly different
2013-11-15 23:10:37	raylu	you generated all of the keys in db so you can be sure they're length k
2013-11-15 23:10:42	raylu	what's the point in checking again in mismatch_checker?
2013-11-15 23:10:59	darkf	what if your generator is wrong?
2013-11-15 23:11:17	raylu	what if a != NULL?
2013-11-15 23:11:30	darkf	a generator is not a constant
2013-11-15 23:11:31	raylu	anything can be wrong at any time; bugs happeen everywhere. that doesn't mean you should check everything all the time

2013-11-15 23:12:17	raylu	but i don't think setting a threshold for how likely there is a bug and using that to decide whether to randomly throw in an extra invariant check makes any sense

2013-11-24 12:29:59	Dreeass	Should I use plain green and blue or should I use some blue-green for the coasts and some brown for the mountains?
2013-11-24 12:40:45	Dreeass	darkf?
2013-11-24 12:41:14	darkf	use whatever colors you like. experiment with it.
2013-11-24 12:44:56	Naphatul	need some help here, given a list of points and distances how do i figure out where i am? (2d points)
2013-11-24 12:45:09	darkf	wat.
2013-11-24 12:46:03	Naphatul	i've got a list of 2d points (x,y) and my distance to them, given that how do i figure out my position (x, y)
2013-11-24 12:47:02	darkf	Naphatul: is this homework
2013-11-24 12:47:46	Dreeass	darkf, like it? http://i.imgur.com/JmCGnPD.png
2013-11-24 12:48:11	darkf	Dreeass: i like it. i'd probably darken the blue.
2013-11-24 12:48:31	Dreeass	darkf, alright, thanks. I'll send you when it's a bit better.
2013-11-24 12:48:52	Dreeass	Napahatul, do you have the delta X & Y or the magnitude?
2013-11-24 12:49:23	darkf	i'm assuming the distance is a scalar and he has a list of points
2013-11-24 12:49:25	darkf	:p
2013-11-24 12:49:33	Naphatul	yeah
2013-11-24 12:49:51	Dreeass	so (x1, y1), (x2, y2)...?
2013-11-24 12:49:56	darkf	Naphatul: so, figure it out. and is this for homework or are you solving an actual problem?
2013-11-24 12:50:12	darkf	Dreeass: (x1, y1, d1), ... presumably
2013-11-24 12:50:22	Dreeass	d1?

2013-11-24 12:50:39	darkf	hf
2013-11-24 12:56:52	Naphatul	darkf: it's sort of homework, and yes it's x, y, d
2013-11-24 12:58:35	Naphatul	was the distance between 2 points d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) ?
2013-11-24 13:00:32	darkf	IIRC yes
2013-11-24 13:00:38	darkf	well
2013-11-24 13:00:43	darkf	it's probably x1 - x2
2013-11-24 13:00:44	darkf	etc
2013-11-24 13:05:48	darkf	you know this sounds suspiciously like trying to solve minesweeper doesnt it

2013-11-24 13:12:00	Dreeass	matter*
2013-11-24 13:13:22	Dreeass	Naphatul, is your question solved now?

2013-11-24 13:18:05	darkf	well I came up with an algorithm that probably works. that wasn't so hard. I should pat myself on the back.

2013-11-24 13:32:02	Naphatul	not really still have no idea how to find where i am
2013-11-24 13:32:34	darkf	Naphatul: isn't the point to think about the problem and come up with a solution?
2013-11-24 13:33:10	Naphatul	it is, and i'm thinking about it but still nothing
2013-11-24 13:33:56	darkf	well it took me about 2 or 3 minutes to draw a picture and solve it (most of it was drawing in mspaint) and i am really bad at coming up with algorithms :P
2013-11-24 13:34:03	darkf	i haven't tested it but it sounds legit
2013-11-24 13:34:13	darkf	and also slow but who cares it's not like you have 100M points
2013-11-24 13:34:58	-->	Hassen has joined #learnprogramming
2013-11-24 13:35:28	Dreeass	Naphatul, can you reformulate your question once more? I just didn't understand the question. And that is not uncommon.
2013-11-24 13:36:17	darkf	Dreeass: you have a list of (x, y, d) vectors where d = the distance to the target. you want to find the (x, y) of the target.
2013-11-24 13:36:17	Naphatul	i need to find a point in 2d space, i'm given a list of 2d points and their distance to the unkown one like (x, y, d)
2013-11-24 13:37:17	Dreeass	Don't use x and y twice please.
2013-11-24 13:37:41	Dreeass	the x and y you need to find, are those relative?
2013-11-24 13:37:49	Dreeass	or are the x and y given relative?
2013-11-24 13:38:00	Naphatul	x and y are the coordinates of the points
2013-11-24 13:38:03	Naphatul	d is the distance to them
2013-11-24 13:38:06	Naphatul	from an unknown point
2013-11-24 13:38:33	Dreeass	and you need the x and y  from the unknown point,
2013-11-24 13:38:34	Dreeass	?
2013-11-24 13:38:35	Naphatul	darkf: so far i'm thinking of finding the intersection of all points with a circle with radius d
2013-11-24 13:38:40	Naphatul	Dreeass: yeah
2013-11-24 13:38:51	darkf	Naphatul: that's exactly what i came up with lol
2013-11-24 13:38:58	Dreeass	and all of the points have the same unknown point?
2013-11-24 13:39:10	Naphatul	darkf: yeah but how do i find all the intersections?
2013-11-24 13:39:26	Naphatul	Dreeass: yes i only need to find 1 point, the other points are known and the distance is to the unkown point
2013-11-24 13:39:40	Dreeass	Simple
2013-11-24 13:39:45	darkf	Naphatul: find all points around the point with respect to d, then do an intersection on all of them
2013-11-24 13:39:49	Dreeass	I'll send you a picture, let me draw it
2013-11-24 13:40:55	darkf	Naphatul: it's seriously like 3 steps just go code it

2013-11-24 14:20:37	Dreeass	So number 1 equals the radial which is known since it is the magnitude
2013-11-24 14:21:09	Dreeass	the point where 2 and 1 is calculateable
2013-11-24 14:21:41	Dreeass	connect the green and yellow centers of the circle and you got the angle between 3 and 1
2013-11-24 14:21:52	Dreeass	then you can calculate 2 and 3
2013-11-24 14:22:28	Dreeass	and that should give you the location of the unkown point since you can turn the triangle between yellow and green around
2013-11-24 14:23:00	Dreeass	I'm just not gonna give you all of the calculations because that would take me too long
2013-11-24 14:23:44	Dreeass	you actually only need 2 points then to calculate the unknown point

2013-11-24 17:40:09	adam789654123	hello
2013-11-24 17:40:36	greencypher	I just wrote this component for a program I'm working on
2013-11-24 17:40:37	Amadiro	granra, no, buffer is not a struct
2013-11-24 17:40:40	greencypher	And it gets the job done
2013-11-24 17:40:42	Amadiro	otherwise that code would not compile
2013-11-24 17:40:53	greencypher	But I was wondering if anyone had any ideas for a more elegant execution http://bpaste.net/show/AHyu2w7aNe0myfWoix6a/

2013-11-24 17:41:11	Amadiro	Hassen, that doesn't really answer my question...
2013-11-24 17:41:18	greencypher	It's Ruby - the goal is to iterate through Dates on a csv and find the most common days of the week
2013-11-24 17:43:23	granra	Amadiro: hmm, struct pixel buffer[480][640]; happens earlier in the code
2013-11-24 17:43:43	Hassen	Amadiro, an amateur group of persons who code and program pieces of tools and softwares
2013-11-24 17:43:48	Amadiro	granra, is "buffer" a struct then?
2013-11-24 17:43:57	Amadiro	Hassen, well, there is this channel and /r/learnprogramming
2013-11-24 17:44:25	Hassen	doh...
2013-11-24 17:45:06	granra	Amadiro: I'm sorry I'm kinda struggling with is before that line there is struct pixel{ char r; char g; char b; char a; }
2013-11-24 17:45:34	Amadiro	granra, yes, but the point is that "buffer" is not a struct, it's a double-array of structs (decays to a pointer to struct)

2013-11-24 17:46:16	granra	ahh I see
2013-11-24 17:46:40	Amadiro	granra, so what that other code does, is it simply casts that (struct pixel*) pointer to a (char*) pointer
2013-11-24 17:46:48	Amadiro	(which very likely is actually incorrect code)
2013-11-24 17:47:05	granra	ok
2013-11-24 17:47:27	-->	Cirus has joined #learnprogramming
2013-11-24 17:47:36	Amadiro	granra, the author of that code probably thought that if he casts a (struct pixel*) to a (char*) pointer, he could access the individual components of the struct as chars
2013-11-24 17:48:12	granra	I see
2013-11-24 17:48:43	Amadiro	(that's not actually a legal thing to do in C, but in most compilers, it will likely work)
2013-11-24 17:50:16	granra	ok, this is from an assignment on chache and it's written on paper. Should I then assume we can access the individual components?
2013-11-24 17:50:30	granra	that seems logical right?
2013-11-24 17:51:28	Amadiro	granra, I don't know what the rest of the code does with the resulting (char*) pointer

2013-11-25 10:06:22	Amadiro	Ayey_, I've used SDL from CL, if that counts
2013-11-25 10:06:41	Amadiro	"game library" is rather vague
2013-11-25 10:06:50	Amadiro	But I don't think you'll really find much else for CL anyway
2013-11-25 10:06:56	darkf	Amadiro: oh right I remember what I was going to ask you like yesterday
2013-11-25 10:07:37	darkf	Amadiro: say you're making a tile-based game like a roguelike, for static tiles like walls or plants vs dynamic tiles like monsters, would you rather hold them in a separate array or as a layered array?
2013-11-25 10:08:01	Amadiro	what's a layered array?
2013-11-25 10:09:23	darkf	Amadiro: an n-d array where each dimension represents a layer (i.e., background layer, prop layer, monster layer, whatever)
2013-11-25 10:10:42	Amadiro	darkf, well, conceptually that'd be the same, but cache-friendlyness-wise and rendering-friendlyness-wise, separate arrays are probably more convenient
2013-11-25 10:10:51	Amadiro	there could be other solutions as well, though
2013-11-25 10:10:56	Amadiro	afk, gotta catch a train

2013-11-25 10:35:33	<--	timg has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2013-11-25 10:37:56	darkf	Amadiro: well by going through the background array, rendering each tile on screen, then rendering monsters, etc. I sometimes use a growing list/array of monsters but that sounds bad now that I think about it
2013-11-25 10:38:03	Amadiro	I need to reduce the number of IRC channels I'm in
2013-11-25 10:38:21	Amadiro	or my scrollback size, I guess. Downloading the scrollback each time I connect to my bnc takes like 20 seconds and 20 megabytes of data or so
2013-11-25 10:38:42	Amadiro	darkf, what API/library do you use for drawing?
2013-11-25 10:39:05	darkf	Amadiro: I am talking conceptually because I do this a lot in any tile-based game across APIs/languages
2013-11-25 10:40:44	Amadiro	darkf, well, building your scene/scenegraph usually boils down to bringing it into a format that is most convenient for the renderer
2013-11-25 10:40:47	Amadiro	since that's the part that does the most work
2013-11-25 10:41:03	Amadiro	but there are a lot of different approaches on how to do layering in a top-down isometric game
2013-11-25 10:41:13	darkf	Amadiro: okay, well most of this is top-down 2D
2013-11-25 10:41:22	Amadiro	but that depends more on what the game is supposed to look like/how it's supposed to work
2013-11-25 10:41:39	darkf	Amadiro: using like, canvas or SDL-like blitting
2013-11-25 10:44:29	Amadiro	darkf, I think there was a post about it on /r/gamedev a day ago or so, lemme check
2013-11-25 10:44:29	Amadiro	darkf, http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r4mj3/zorder_in_topdown_2d_gamestutorial/

2013-11-25 10:44:30	Amadiro	as you can see, dynamic z-order is another way to do it
2013-11-25 10:44:41	Amadiro	there is also using a depth-buffer if your renderer supports that etc
2013-11-25 10:44:49	Amadiro	each have their dis/advantages

2013-11-25 11:21:58	Le_Sphinx	?
2013-11-25 11:22:15	Amadiro	darkf, if you use a depth buffer, sorting/overlapping happens automatically, so you don't really need any layers at all
2013-11-25 11:22:24	Amadiro	which is convenient, but transparent objects become a bit of an issue
2013-11-25 11:22:31	LightMystic	I'd hate to be a chump, but anyone know C++ and got a moment? I'm having a noob problem with function arguments and variables lol
2013-11-25 11:22:34	darkf	Amadiro: I don't usually draw in 3D
2013-11-25 11:22:43	darkf	LightMystic: go ahead and ask
2013-11-25 11:22:59	darkf	Amadiro: er, by 3D I mean with like quads
2013-11-25 11:23:04	LightMystic	Well I've been trying to get a parameter for the main function, but when it hits the IF statement, it kills over.. http://pastebin.com/rpr5zCrC
2013-11-25 11:23:05	Amadiro	darkf, 3D or 2D doesn't really make any difference, your drawing mechanism just has to have support for a depth buffer, that's all
2013-11-25 11:23:10	darkf	I usually use crap libraries
2013-11-25 11:23:36	darkf	LightMystic: main doesn't take a string. you'll have to extract it from argv
2013-11-25 11:23:50	LightMystic	Ah okay
2013-11-25 11:23:54	Amadiro	if you use opengl, you can even go completely crazy and have each sprite have a per-pixel depth, heh
2013-11-25 11:24:07	Amadiro	that way two overlapping sprites could "entangle" in complex ways
2013-11-25 11:24:14	Amadiro	but overkill for most things, most likely
2013-11-25 11:24:15	darkf	LightMystic: usually your signature is either main() or main(int argc, char *argv[]) or some variation thereof

2013-11-25 12:05:56	LightMystic	Alright, so hit another small road bump.. You see I'm trying to convert a powershell script to C++ the best I can and I need to know how to do a multiline variable. Apparently in powershell they are using @'s for it, but I'm not sure how to go about it in c++. http://pastebin.com/Gat93tKn
2013-11-25 12:07:32	darkf	good question
2013-11-25 12:07:47	-->	Left_Turn has joined #learnprogramming
2013-11-25 12:08:06	LightMystic	I read you can use \ to escape the scripts new lines, but I'm not entirely sure if that's whats happening in the powershell or not.
2013-11-25 12:08:39	darkf	LightMystic: not really
2013-11-25 12:08:48	darkf	trying to see if C++11 has multiline literals but I don't think so
2013-11-25 12:09:50	darkf	LightMystic: well in any case you can escape newlines with \n and if you want you can span them across lines like "a" "b" "c"
2013-11-25 12:11:00	LightMystic	I mean literally escape the new lines.. For an in-script multiline.
2013-11-25 12:11:00	darkf	yeah can't do that
2013-11-25 12:12:23	LightMystic	Well, it worked.. lol
2013-11-25 12:12:48	LightMystic	But I see problems in the logic of it, so back to the drawing board haha

2013-11-25 12:40:03	LightMystic	I've seen a ton of use of char arrays with char*, so I'm wondering.. Is use of strings considered a bad habbit then?
2013-11-25 12:40:03	darkf	LightMystic: in C++, the opposite.
2013-11-25 12:40:26	LightMystic	I'm using C++, but I see more character arrays now than strings.. Which is the best to use?
2013-11-25 12:40:35	darkf	std::string.
2013-11-25 12:40:58	LightMystic	Ah okay, that's what I normally do.. I'll just .c_str() when I have to and try to push for strings then lol
2013-11-25 12:41:27	darkf	c_str() gives you a const char* which you should be mindful of if you pass it to something wanting to mutate it.
2013-11-25 12:42:02	Amadiro	LightMystic, usually you want to use std::string, but there are cases where they are inappropriate, and better alternatives exist (bstring, qstring and in rare cases, char arrays)
2013-11-25 12:42:17	Amadiro	But generally, use std::string and c_str() if a function asks you for a char array.
2013-11-25 12:42:29	LightMystic	Ah okay, sounds good!
2013-11-25 12:42:45	LightMystic	Reading a file as bytes didn't like the strings, so I had to c_str() it

2013-11-25 12:45:26	darkf	shouldn't ifstream's open take a string too?
2013-11-25 12:46:02	LightMystic	But now I fear I may have to char* everything cause the next part of this powershell script looks like its turning everything into bytes.
2013-11-25 12:46:19	darkf	what do you mean "turning into bytes"?
2013-11-25 12:46:44	LightMystic	    # the request body should sandwich the image bytes between the 2 boilerplate blocks     $encoding = New-Object Text.ASCIIEncoding     $data = $encoding.GetBytes($part1) + $imageBytes + $encoding.GetBytes($part2)
2013-11-25 12:46:44	darkf	why are you even porting powershell to C++?
2013-11-25 12:46:56	LightMystic	I want a single, standlone binary to do the same as the script..
2013-11-25 12:47:15	darkf	LightMystic: an std::string is internally a char[] AFAIK. same thing as bytes.
2013-11-25 12:47:17	darkf	also.
2013-11-25 12:47:22	darkf	then why are you using C++
2013-11-25 12:47:55	LightMystic	Because I'm better at it than other binary languages.. I mean I could just use C# or what not, but that requires .NET depenancies and I tend to hate on it heh

2013-11-25 12:51:14	LightMystic	Hm? I'm just going with whatever sounds right.. I'm tired and basically trying to explain I would like to make a binary that does the job. The best language I know for that would be C++.
2013-11-25 12:51:27	Amadiro	LightMystic, what are you actually trying to achieve
2013-11-25 12:51:28	darkf	ok then
2013-11-25 12:51:36	Amadiro	to make a program that does not require the user to download any extra software?
2013-11-25 12:53:22	LightMystic	Amadiro: Well.. I'm trying to make a binary where you drag an image file onto it, it converts the image to bytes and sandwiches it between two "boilerplates" as this guy calls it, post a web request to google, then return the resulting url and open it in the default browser.
2013-11-25 12:53:45	darkf	the image is already bytes
2013-11-25 12:53:48	LightMystic	In other words, making a desktop-accessible Google "Search by Image" option
2013-11-25 12:55:07	LightMystic	Please, no technicalities for failure to be specific to the upmost detail at 7 in the morning? I'm doing my best to program, let alone describe what I'm porting over to C++ lol
2013-11-25 12:55:24	darkf	then why not program when you have adequate sleep
2013-11-25 12:55:31	LightMystic	To be honest, I'm doing my best to wrap my mind around it as it is..
2013-11-25 12:55:45	LightMystic	And I can't cause once I get some sleep, I got 4 business article reviews for college..
2013-11-25 12:55:55	LightMystic	The a poetry essay / final.. And the etcetera after..
2013-11-25 12:55:56	tangentstorm	that makes no sense.
2013-11-25 12:56:13	LightMystic	What makes no sense?
2013-11-25 12:56:19	darkf	anything
2013-11-25 12:56:29	darkf	why are we living in a matrix
2013-11-25 12:56:34	LightMystic	Good, then we're all caught up..
2013-11-25 12:56:49	tangentstorm	trying to solve problems when you're tired takes longer than solving them when you're alert.
2013-11-25 12:56:58	darkf	far longer.
2013-11-25 12:57:00	darkf	if at all
2013-11-25 12:57:12	LightMystic	tangentstorm: Good point, but I won't have time when I'm done.. lol
2013-11-25 12:57:19	tangentstorm	yes you do.
2013-11-25 12:57:23	darkf	then make time or schedule it for a day after or something.
2013-11-25 12:57:24	tangentstorm	or you don't anyway.
2013-11-25 12:57:27	LightMystic	^
2013-11-25 12:58:08	tangentstorm	i mean  a:= work on problem + sleep    vs   b:= sleep + work on problem....   a > b.
2013-11-25 12:58:16	tangentstorm	in terms of time cost.
2013-11-25 12:58:20	LightMystic	Alright.. I've just got this left.. http://pastebin.com/VHxZt14a
2013-11-25 12:59:58	tangentstorm	huh.. is powershell basically a .net scripting language?
2013-11-25 13:00:56	LightMystic	Close it seems.. lol
2013-11-25 13:01:16	LightMystic	Unfortunately, I'm trying to keep as far from .NET as possible.. So good ol' Code::Blocks and GCC for me

2013-11-25 13:17:08	LightMystic	Well I haven't used C++ in years so I haven't added libraries in a long time.. I just need to find a non-.NET way of making an HTTP request, sending POST, and stopping automatic redirection..

2013-11-25 13:44:16	tangentstorm	what you're asking about the environment is sort of like asking... "how can i learn haskell without types?"

2013-11-25 13:46:20	darkf	tangentstorm: i mean if there is a good argument for it...
2013-11-25 13:48:47	tangentstorm	as long as you're convinced programming is about text in text files, nothing i say is really going to get through to you.
2013-11-25 13:49:52	tangentstorm	smalltalk is different, and part of what makes it different is the environment.
2013-11-25 13:49:58	darkf	tangentstorm: then what does the GUI give me visually that is more powerful than editing text?
2013-11-25 13:50:17	tangentstorm	maybe a better analogy would be trying to use erlang with only one process.
2013-11-25 13:50:31	tangentstorm	or using python or haskell without the shell.

2013-11-25 13:54:03	tangentstorm	suppose you're in python and you write this class Meh: def xxx(self): self.yyy()   ;   Meh().xxx()
2013-11-25 13:54:30	tangentstorm	python's going to give you a NameError
2013-11-25 13:58:11	tangentstorm	in smalltalk, you'd get a  doesNotUnderstand exception, and it would pop up the debugger.
2013-11-25 13:58:11	tangentstorm	then, inside the debugger, you have the option of implementing the  xxx  message and resuming the script.

2013-11-25 13:58:11	tangentstorm	i suppose there's no particular reason python couldn't be made to do that too, but it doesn't.
2013-11-25 13:58:11	darkf	yeah ruby has method_missing
2013-11-25 13:58:11	tangentstorm	yeah and python has getattr()
2013-11-25 13:58:11	tangentstorm	__getattr__ i mean
2013-11-25 13:58:11	tangentstorm	but i'm talking about hooking into the python debugger api and catching exceptions and whatnot.
2013-11-25 13:58:46	tangentstorm	you'd probably have to hack a bit at the python internenals even with the debug hooks...
2013-11-25 13:59:42	darkf	heh

2013-11-25 14:00:19	tangentstorm	there's also the message finder, which can show you all objects in the system that implement a particular message.
2013-11-25 14:00:29	LightMystic	Alright, so that didn't exactly work since I would have to have VC++ installed I think.. Then I tried WinSock and more poop hit the fan. I'm not liking HTTP requests very much anymore..

2013-11-25 14:12:24	darkf	would take like 15 minutes in haskell :)
2013-11-25 14:12:30	darkf	and you get a nice binary.
2013-11-25 14:13:03	LightMystic	Well I haven't touched C++ til I had a class on it, had that four about 15-16 weeks, then haven't touched it since.. So it's whooping my butt lol

2013-11-26 15:22:00	Xenon77	how does one differentiate software design activities and software design deliverables?
2013-11-26 15:26:39	LightMystic	I would assume just from that sentence that the software design activities are what you do to design the softwhere, while the software design deliverables would be..results from the software design, such as prototypes of said software? Just a guess though.
2013-11-26 15:27:20	Xenon77	LightMystic, I would think so too. But I've been doing alot of research and I just can't seem to find distinguishing examples between the two
2013-11-26 15:27:32	Xenon77	the examples all seem like deliverables if you ask me.
2013-11-26 15:28:08	LightMystic	Sounds more like homework.. Specifically, the homework with very fine lines between the two subjects and very little on one or both of the subjects.
2013-11-26 15:28:55	Xenon77	LightMystic, it's not homework
2013-11-26 15:28:59	Xenon77	just food for thought
2013-11-26 15:29:35	LightMystic	Ah, fun.. Yeah just mentioned it cause it sounds like homework I usually get. That fine lined stuff hehe
2013-11-26 15:31:15	Xenon77	do people really follow the software development life cycle?
2013-11-26 15:32:09	Xenon77	or is it more theory than anything else?
2013-11-26 15:32:15	LightMystic	I would guess so. It helps keep things more in order and proper, or so my classes tell me. Especially if you're doing it for a company, then you best follow whatever process they go with.

2013-11-26 15:34:39	LightMystic	Any chance are you familiar with C++ and stringstream? lol

2013-11-26 15:35:16	-->	duggiefresh has joined #learnprogramming
2013-11-26 15:36:08	LightMystic	I've been using http://pastebin.com/RmycHWEE this to take a file and read it into a string. But it seems to miss the first line of data in an image. Do you know what might fix that?
2013-11-26 15:38:03	Xenon77	LightMystic, what are you trying to do with the image?
2013-11-26 15:38:35	LightMystic	I want to read it into a string, wrap it in header information, and use winsock to POST it to an online script.
2013-11-26 15:38:50	LightMystic	But its failing to recognize the image online due to missing that tiny pinch of data, I think..
2013-11-26 15:40:09	Xenon77	ok. don't know too much about image processing. but my best advice would be to use a ready made library for that kind of thing. would save you alot of time and headache
2013-11-26 15:40:57	LightMystic	I've had a ton of problems with libraries and it's not even image processing, it's just file to bytes conversion. I need a string of bytes for the query.
2013-11-26 15:43:47	Xenon77	have you tried #C++ ?
2013-11-26 15:44:04	LightMystic	You mean C#?
2013-11-26 15:45:36	Xenon77	what language are you using?
2013-11-26 15:45:49	LightMystic	C++
2013-11-26 15:46:20	Xenon77	yes, you should try asking in #C++
2013-11-26 15:46:31	LightMystic	Oh, you mean the IRC lol
2013-11-26 15:46:39	Xenon77	yes :)
2013-11-26 15:47:27	LightMystic	Perhaps I shall lol

Everytime i sit down and try to solve a problem(Euler or MegaProject), i always get stuck really quickly, trying to solve it in a functional way instead of imperativ. Googleing always seem to bring more confusion than result. Anyone ever tried something similar? Mainly been trying with Clojure and Common Lisp

2013-11-29 11:28:15	RubyPinch	gedit is a different thing, gedit, nano, vi, vim, emacs, etc etc are all for editing files, when you run python or ipython directly, you can directly type out python commands

2013-11-29 11:29:28	RubyPinch	it makes it much easier to test one or two lines of python, instead of needing to use a file, then running that

2013-12-03 13:19:52	knives47z	Perl question. is it okay to have multiple <STDIN> in a script? I first used a <STDIN> to define an array. I assigned another scalar to <STDIN> as a conditional for a if then else group of statements. Perl accepts my first <STDIN> but it doesn't even wait for the input from the second and just runs the results from the statements.

2013-12-03 13:39:43	tangentstorm	knives47z: you can't really do @x=<STDIN> and then $x=<STDIN> because the @= consumes the entire input, up to end of file.

2013-12-03 13:49:50	knives47z	tangentstorm, is there a workaround to use the stdin twice? or at least limit the input from the first stdin?
2013-12-03 13:50:18	tangentstorm	knives47z: sure.. just use $x=<STDIN> ... then it reads only one line.
2013-12-03 13:51:50	knives47z	well the short program I'm trying to write involves sorting an array of names alphabetically.. so there isn't a way to use <STDIN> again after it's been assigned to an array?
2013-12-03 13:52:05	tangentstorm	no
2013-12-03 13:52:11	tangentstorm	not as far as i know.
2013-12-03 13:52:48	tangentstorm	it stops assigning to the array when <STDIN> is closed.
2013-12-03 13:52:58	tangentstorm	so there's no more input.
2013-12-03 13:53:42	tangentstorm	are you manually typing the lines each time?
2013-12-03 13:54:40	tangentstorm	or are you using  perl < whatever.txt    and then trying to also read input interactively?
2013-12-03 13:57:41	knives47z	manually typing the lines in from the shell.
2013-12-03 13:58:18	<--	juser has quit (Quit: Forlater kanalen)
2013-12-03 14:00:14	tangentstorm	okay. so what do you type when you're done with the array?

2013-12-03 14:02:04	knives47z	ctrl+d, basically shell end of input command. so far it hasn't been working as intended, lol

2013-12-03 14:02:49	tangentstorm	yeah.. well, that's telling the system to close stdin. :)
2013-12-03 14:03:18	tangentstorm	you could just check for an explicit terminator.. like a blank line or something.
2013-12-03 14:05:46	-->	hippiestick has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-03 14:06:11	knives47z	so what you're telling me is that Perl is still looking for more input when there isn't any? and I have to explicitly tell it where the end is? is there a specific code i can use to define a explicit terminator or is that another one of those regex things?
2013-12-03 14:08:02	tangentstorm	well... yeah... i mean... what do you use the next <STDIN> for?

2013-12-03 14:11:04	knives47z	the next <STDIN> is just asking for a Y or N. and then depending on the answer it does different stuff with the first array received from <STDIN>
2013-12-03 14:19:46	tangentstorm	knives47z: perl -e 'while (<>) { m/^$/ ? last : print }'
2013-12-03 14:21:06	tangentstorm	hrm
2013-12-03 14:21:11	tangentstorm	i screwed that up

2013-12-03 14:22:18	-->	hassen has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-03 14:23:36	knives47z	i'm running the whole code from a single .pl file, not sure -e option would work?
2013-12-03 14:23:37	tangentstorm	perl -e 'while (<>) { m/^$/ ? last : print } print "ok. one more:\n"; die ($y=<>);'
2013-12-03 14:24:07	tangentstorm	the -e just lets you run an entire program on the command line.
2013-12-03 14:26:59	tangentstorm	i probably should have said $_ instead of $y

2013-12-03 18:23:18	ElectricSheep	With function declarations in C (and i think C++), the extern is implicit.
2013-12-03 18:23:18	FilthyPeasant	I did a forward declaration to readnumber doe :/
2013-12-03 18:23:46	ElectricSheep	What is the full error, and how are you compiling
2013-12-03 18:23:52	tangentstorm	i don't know what i'm talking about with c++ :)

2013-12-03 18:25:02	ElectricSheep	I'm not famliar with code::blocks
2013-12-03 18:25:20	tangentstorm	try running   g++ MAIN.CPP IO.CPP && ./a.out

2013-12-03 18:26:30	tangentstorm	well you must have it since you're compling with gcc...
2013-12-03 18:26:50	ElectricSheep	The error is not a compliation error
2013-12-03 18:26:54	ElectricSheep	But a linking error.
2013-12-03 18:26:57	tangentstorm	right
2013-12-03 18:27:06	ElectricSheep	On the command line, you would build with:
2013-12-03 18:27:07	tangentstorm	because his editor doesn't know to include both files.
2013-12-03 18:27:11	ElectricSheep	g++ -o out.exe main.cpp IO.cpp
2013-12-03 18:27:29	FilthyPeasant	same error
2013-12-03 18:27:42	FilthyPeasant	This can't be that complicated, it's such a simple program after all
2013-12-03 18:27:45	tangentstorm	FilthyPeasant: go figure out where g++ is installed.
2013-12-03 18:28:08	tangentstorm	or where gcc is installed, and look right next to that file for g++ :)

2013-12-03 18:32:13	FilthyPeasant	Isn't there another way to fix this damned error?
2013-12-03 18:32:33	jesyspa	Your IDE probably isn't aware you want it to build both files.
2013-12-03 18:32:36	tipsyTentacle	Quick help question, how would YOU copy a file from a local UNIX server process to a local UNIX client process.
2013-12-03 18:32:41	jesyspa	Probably because you incorrectly added the second one.
2013-12-03 18:33:40	tipsyTentacle	I am hoping there's an easy function for this. Otherwise, I am writing and reading individual bytes manually from server-->client.
2013-12-03 18:34:07	FilthyPeasant	I'm pretty sure i did it correctly new file->.cpp
2013-12-03 18:34:14	FilthyPeasant	and into correct directory

2013-12-03 18:38:32	FilthyPeasant	when i deleted, created a new one, did everything exactly the same and pasted old code it started working
2013-12-03 18:38:58	FilthyPeasant	maybe 3rd time for me, did a much larger program and had the same issue, couldn't continue with the program because of this issue
2013-12-03 18:39:58	jesyspa	You could probably have also edited the makefile by hand.

2013-12-04 13:59:34	Annie1	dynamic dObj = System.Web.Helpers.Json.Decode(contentsOfJsonFile) // returns dynamic variable..

2013-12-04 15:20:57	ShredDurst	since i'm counting any punctuation and having upper and lower case letters count as the same character
2013-12-04 15:21:07	tangentstorm	ok
2013-12-04 15:21:16	ShredDurst	i.e. 'A' and 'a' will be counted as the same character for the purposes of this function
2013-12-04 15:21:21	<--	Annie1 has quit
2013-12-04 15:21:32	ShredDurst	i ignore them
2013-12-04 15:22:37	ShredDurst	my instructor hinted that creating a structure would be the way to go but i'm not sure of how to implement that
2013-12-04 15:23:44	ShredDurst	i want to read in the ascii value of the character and assign that to an element, and then increment the element every time i find another character of that value
2013-12-04 15:24:04	tangentstorm	that seems like a reasonable approach.
2013-12-04 15:24:41	tangentstorm	you know that ascii characters are ordered right, and you can convert them to a number?
2013-12-04 15:25:25	ShredDurst	i know they're ordered but i'm a little fuzzy on hyow to convert them to a number
2013-12-04 15:25:30	ShredDurst	*how
2013-12-04 15:25:32	tangentstorm	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4790607/get-the-ascii-value-for-a-char-ord-equivalent-in-c
2013-12-04 15:26:12	ShredDurst	oh, that seems easy enough
2013-12-04 15:26:41	tangentstorm	the indices of an array are also numbered...
2013-12-04 15:26:59	tangentstorm	or vector.
2013-12-04 15:27:25	tangentstorm	the c++ guys in here seem to prefer vectors over arrays.
2013-12-04 15:28:34	ShredDurst	i'm unfamiliar with vectors right now
2013-12-04 15:28:56	ShredDurst	i would run into problems if i try to add an int value to a char value, right?
2013-12-04 15:29:04	tangentstorm	i think they're just memory managed or something. probably not worth worrying about since you have a fixed size array of ints right now anyway.
2013-12-04 15:29:14	tangentstorm	i don't know.
2013-12-04 15:29:28	ElectricSheep	arrays are sized at compile-time
2013-12-04 15:29:28	Amadiro	ShredDurst, overflowing chars is undefined, overflowing unsigned chars is defined
2013-12-04 15:29:29	tangentstorm	in c that's perfectly okay.
2013-12-04 15:29:30	ElectricSheep	And cannot be resized.
2013-12-04 15:29:32	ElectricSheep	Arrays can be.
2013-12-04 15:29:35	ElectricSheep	*Vectors
2013-12-04 15:29:36	Amadiro	but either may not be what you want
2013-12-04 15:30:41	ShredDurst	so that i don't have 68 different variable definitions, i'd want to write a for loop to automatically assign an int to a char
2013-12-04 15:31:09	ShredDurst	going through the ASCII table, '!' would be my first element, ' " ' would be my second, etc
2013-12-04 15:31:18	tangentstorm	'assign' is a loaded word. you want to 'map' a given char to a number represesting a slot in the array.
2013-12-04 15:31:22	ShredDurst	would i be able to write something like
2013-12-04 15:31:32	ShredDurst	let me pastebin it real quick
2013-12-04 15:31:55	ElectricSheep	Wouldn't it be nice if you just had a compile-time array of structures that associated each possible input with its corresponding output?
2013-12-04 15:31:57	ElectricSheep	*cough*
2013-12-04 15:32:27	tangentstorm	ohh.... good call.
2013-12-04 15:34:37	ShredDurst	so would i want to create a structure where the members are an int corresponding to the element number of the array and the ascii value of the character that corresponds to that element?
2013-12-04 15:35:50	-->	duggiefresh has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-04 15:36:21	ElectricSheep	Think of it like this
2013-12-04 15:36:27	ElectricSheep	All inputs are ASCII characters
2013-12-04 15:36:43	ElectricSheep	There aren't too many of those, and they correspond to numbers quite nicely...]
2013-12-04 15:37:05	ElectricSheep	You could have an array where each members index is related to the ASCII character numeric value.
2013-12-04 15:37:10	ElectricSheep	And the member itself....
2013-12-04 15:37:21	ElectricSheep	Well, you could make that a lot of things
2013-12-04 15:37:35	ElectricSheep	You could make those members pointers to the actual counters you want to increment.
2013-12-04 15:38:23	ElectricSheep	Or not, you could aggregate counters that should be part of the same 'letter' afterwards.
2013-12-04 15:38:55	ElectricSheep	So the idea would be take a character
2013-12-04 15:39:11	ElectricSheep	Its value is the index of the array
2013-12-04 15:39:23	ElectricSheep	The lookup gives you what counter you want to increment.
2013-12-04 15:44:48	ShredDurst	so let me see if i understand this correctly

2013-12-04 20:13:37	SirSkidmore	lrnProgr: it honestly depends on who you talk to I think
2013-12-04 20:13:44	SirSkidmore	everyone has a different opinion
2013-12-04 20:13:56	lrnProgr	I'm currently a "Jack of all trades, master of none", I'd like to specialize myself in 1 of the 3 languages mentioned.
2013-12-04 20:14:12	tangentstorm	i worked through euler #1 in j again, and explained my answer in detail. i don't mind posting this one because it's basically fizzbuzz: https://github.com/tangentstorm/tangentlabs/blob/master/j/euler/euler0001.ijs
2013-12-04 20:14:26	Amadiro	lrnProgr, then do some research on which one seems to be most popular/on the rise/has most jobs offer
2013-12-04 20:14:46	tangentstorm	there's always plenty of php code to fix... ;)
2013-12-04 20:15:57	lrnProgr	Amadiro, I've tried that and it didn't really help. PHP seems to be the most popular, Ruby's on the rise and Python is continiously mentioned as a great, high-level language with a more shallow learning curve.
2013-12-04 20:16:23	Amadiro	lrnProgr, I think ruby lags behind the other two fairly far in terms of popularity
2013-12-04 20:16:38	jesyspa	lrnProgr: What is it that you care about?
2013-12-04 20:17:10	Amadiro	lrnProgr, but as I said, try to aggregate some numbers -- use google trends to search for various things pertaining the languages, look around for job offers, look at language popularity statistics, et cetera
2013-12-04 20:17:35	powerjerk	I'm partial to python myself
2013-12-04 20:17:36	Amadiro	You'll get a picture of it eventually
2013-12-04 20:17:40	SirSkidmore	lrnProgr: Are you learning for any particular objective?
2013-12-04 20:17:58	SirSkidmore	or are you already in a programming environment?
2013-12-04 20:18:34	lrnProgr	I've signed up a competition sometime in January and I've been told to pick 1 language to specialize in.
2013-12-04 20:18:51	jesyspa	A competition doing what?
2013-12-04 20:19:04	SirSkidmore	for instance, I really love Ruby, but at the same time, a lot of the people I work with use Python and I ended up learning Python anyway haha
2013-12-04 20:19:48	lrnProgr	Programming, you'll get assigned a set of problems and have to finish them in a set amount of time. Best go to the nationals, followed by an international competition.
2013-12-04 20:19:56	jesyspa	What kind of problems?
2013-12-04 20:21:51	lrnProgr	My teacher went to great lenghts to allow me this opportunity and I don't want to let him down. @Jesypa, I don't know. The problems are kept secret until the time of the competition.

2013-12-04 20:22:31	lrnProgr	I've seen the problems from previous years and from what I can tell it's around the "Intermediate'' level of the DailyProgrammer problems.
2013-12-04 20:22:36	tangentstorm	well, there really isn't much difference between ruby and python in terms of expressiveness.

2013-12-04 20:23:25	tangentstorm	there's really no reason to use php unless you're specifically making websites, and even then the other two have better options.

2013-12-04 20:23:42	jesyspa	Until you get an idea of what you will be coding, it's very hard to advise.
2013-12-04 20:24:10	 *	tangentstorm would use j :)
2013-12-04 20:24:17	jesyspa	At the very least, runtime speed vs development speed is a big factor.
2013-12-04 20:24:51	jesyspa	If you want the fastest program, learning Ruby or Python probably won't get you into the winners.  If you need to communicate to a webserver, you'll never be done on time with C.
2013-12-04 20:25:27	SirSkidmore	Is the competition measuring how quickly your programs find the answer or how quickly you program the answer?
2013-12-04 20:25:48	jesyspa	If you have to write a webserver (that's actually relatively common, as far as I've seen) you may be two steps ahead if you go for something like nodejs.
2013-12-04 20:26:24	lrnProgr	I'm allowed to use any language I desire. I just thought that practicing 1 of the 3 big server-side language would prove most beneficial to my future. Since it seems that knowledge of either of those 3 seems to be desired for most jobs.
2013-12-04 20:26:53	jesyspa	What makes you think a server-side language would fit well with these problems?  Will the problem data be sent over HTTP?
2013-12-04 20:28:53	lrnProgr	No, I travel to the location the competition is held and somebody will simply come to your computer and check your answers for the given problems. Judging on the speed you've completed them, whether or not they're bulletproof and in what way you managed to solve the problems.
2013-12-04 20:29:02	<--	kaiza has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2013-12-04 20:30:32	tangentstorm	the big three server side languages? surely that's java, c# and php...
2013-12-04 20:31:18	lrnProgr	All those things aside, I'm looking to improve myself in a language that will still be relevant 4-5 years from now.  From what i've managed to gather so far it's that PHP is most established but people seem to prefer alternatives these days such as Ruby, which is young and doesn't have as much documentation / frameworks / etc
2013-12-04 20:34:36	tangentstorm	which people?
2013-12-04 20:35:11	SirSkidmore	lrnProgr: Ruby has a lot of frameworks and docs...
2013-12-04 20:35:53	tangentstorm	lrnProgr: i used python as my main language for like 12 years... it's not going anywhere. all three of them are likely to remain quite popular.
2013-12-04 20:36:29	lrnProgr	SirSkidmore, Thanks, I don't know a lot about Ruby, sorry.

2013-12-04 20:44:05	Amadiro	lrnProgr, those stats are a bit misleading
2013-12-04 20:44:17	Amadiro	google isn't build on python
2013-12-04 20:44:21	Amadiro	they just use python for some things
2013-12-04 20:44:30	Amadiro	the majority of the hard work they do is done in C++
2013-12-04 20:44:34	SirSkidmore	yep
2013-12-04 20:44:39	Amadiro	likewise facebook doesn't use plain PHP
2013-12-04 20:44:39	tangentstorm	i would certainly not rank ruby as more usable than python.
2013-12-04 20:44:41	Amadiro	they use HipHop
2013-12-04 20:45:06	SirSkidmore	tangentstorm: you wouldn't but I probably would. I'm super biased though
2013-12-04 20:45:58	tangentstorm	i'm tempted to rank ruby close to c because of the way it handles include files.

2013-12-04 21:07:08	@chance	a byte isnt a type, its a size.
2013-12-04 21:07:31	@chance	a char is a byte, a byte is 8 bits, and a bit is a bit.
2013-12-04 21:07:47	Left_Turn	what has its size got to do with its type
2013-12-04 21:08:15	@chance	everything? Thats why we have types in C, to determine the size needed to store a value

2013-12-04 21:10:13	Left_Turn	if you have a function that returns char
2013-12-04 21:10:21	Left_Turn	you can return type int

2013-12-04 21:17:20	Left_Turn	which was an int but use 'c' .. its still legal
2013-12-04 21:17:40	@chance	you can store it in both though, yes, because it is a *literal*
2013-12-04 21:17:55	Left_Turn	his variable was of type int... but in his switch statement he used the variable as a char 'c' .. all i said is it was valid

2013-12-06 09:03:03	tangentstorm	what are you making in elm?

2013-12-06 09:03:31	darkf	i have no idea why.

2013-12-06 15:00:40	MetatronG	You know I always wondered, since index-sequential file organization provides for both sequential and direct access of records, why do we need any other methods of file organization?

2013-12-06 15:03:20	tangentstorm	well, that's a pretty huge reason :)
2013-12-06 15:03:57	tangentstorm	the data you're storing might also not be a flat sequence of data.
2013-12-06 15:05:05	tangentstorm	i mean you can treat a text file as an array of bytes, but often you want to read it line by line...
2013-12-06 15:05:21	tangentstorm	where lines can be arbitrary lengths separated by control characters.

2013-12-06 17:03:28	SrRaven	its basically just "dumbing" down to the biggest "number" right ? so n² or whatev

2013-12-06 17:08:22	Amadiro	SrRaven, it's about taking limits
2013-12-06 17:08:38	SrRaven	yeah low limit,middle limit,upper limit right?
2013-12-06 17:08:50	Amadiro	er?
2013-12-06 17:09:09	Amadiro	Do you know how to take the limit of e.g. (x+1)/x as x goes to infinity?

2013-12-06 17:09:58	SrRaven	nope :(
2013-12-06 17:10:20	Amadiro	SrRaven, then check out the videos on khanacademy on limits first (first 10-or-so videos in the calculus sequence, I think)
2013-12-06 17:11:01	Amadiro	https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus/limits_topic
2013-12-06 17:11:55	SrRaven	10 videos :S ? shiiiit thats not going to be done before my assignment is due lol
2013-12-06 17:12:16	Amadiro	SrRaven, they are only like 5-10 minutes long each.
2013-12-06 17:12:18	SrRaven	oh wait its lim~ stuff :P
2013-12-06 17:12:24	SrRaven	I had that in math yeah
2013-12-06 17:12:44	SrRaven	(sorry im german, so sometimes i a tad "confused" as to what you mean)
2013-12-06 17:12:50	SrRaven	I'm
2013-12-06 17:12:53	Amadiro	grenzwerte, I guess
2013-12-06 17:13:01	SrRaven	yes
2013-12-06 17:13:20	SrRaven	just no idea how to use it with this assignment
2013-12-06 17:13:27	SrRaven	it confuses the living big jeesus out of me
2013-12-06 17:14:23	Amadiro	SrRaven, a function f is basically bounded above by a function g if lim f/g -> c for some constant c
2013-12-06 17:14:40	SrRaven	yeah
2013-12-06 17:14:44	Amadiro	SrRaven, you see, in this fraction, g grows fast enough to keep f "under control"
2013-12-06 17:14:57	Amadiro	if f outgrows g, the limit will tend to inf
2013-12-06 17:15:14	SrRaven	but my assignment is to calculate the running time complexity (?!) of a backtracking algorhytm
2013-12-06 17:15:17	SrRaven	which is the confusing part to me
2013-12-06 17:15:35	<--	mizu_no_oto has quit (Quit: ["Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com"])
2013-12-06 17:15:50	Amadiro	SrRaven, so really when we say that f is in O(g), that means that f is bounded above by g
2013-12-06 17:16:44	Amadiro	an alternative way to say it that is more analytic and less calculus is that abs(f(x)) < g(x)*k for some constant k and a sufficiently large x
2013-12-06 17:17:22	Amadiro	SrRaven, have you tried calculating the running time of, say, long division, addition or multiplication yet?
2013-12-06 17:17:50	Amadiro	figure out the complexity of adding numbers like 345+642 using the algorithm you've learned in elementary school first
2013-12-06 17:17:55	Amadiro	and multiplying them
2013-12-06 17:18:05	SrRaven	nope :)
2013-12-06 17:18:20	Amadiro	for a+b digits (a being the number of digits from the first number, b being the number of digits from the second number)
2013-12-06 17:18:31	Amadiro	how many steps do you need to compute first number + second number?
2013-12-06 17:18:40	Amadiro	how many steps do you need to compute first number*second number?
2013-12-06 17:18:49	Amadiro	that should give you an idea
2013-12-06 17:19:07	SrRaven	ok thanks ill try and think about that :P

2013-12-08 13:44:01	darkf	uhh
2013-12-08 13:44:07	darkf	what kind of question is that

2013-12-08 13:52:49	darkf	not at all
2013-12-08 13:53:08	SCFH	darkf, then how did you learn programming?just typing in the compiler directly?

2013-12-08 13:53:38	SCFH	darkf, then my question is what programming language should I learn first
2013-12-08 13:53:47	darkf	python, there you go
2013-12-08 13:53:53	SCFH	from newbie level till mastering it
2013-12-08 13:54:33	SCFH	ah..most of you assume it's python then..
2013-12-08 13:54:55	darkf	what is there to assume?
2013-12-08 13:55:28	darkf	it is not exactly a fact-based question, it is an experience and sanity based one though!
2013-12-08 13:57:18	SCFH	so your experience with programming made you think it's better to learn python first?reasonable.
2013-12-08 13:57:48	darkf	and not just me!
2013-12-08 13:59:03	SCFH	I see.
2013-12-08 14:00:56	SCFH	mmm...in most of the python books i've ever seen,authors assosiate 'think like a computer scientist' with python
2013-12-08 14:01:00	SCFH	interesting

2013-12-08 17:26:03	jesyspa	std::list<int> numbers; int num; std::ifstream file("my_file.txt"); while (file >> num) numbers.push_back(num);
2013-12-08 17:26:03	jibberjab	the text file has like 4 consecutive lines before a newline with title, id, price, and amount
2013-12-08 17:26:35	jesyspa	Okay, then you should probably make a class that represents that and overload the >> operator for it.

2013-12-08 20:59:53	jibberjab	we have to use linked lists without using <list>
2013-12-08 21:00:03	jibberjab	http://ideone.com/OBV8mJ
2013-12-08 21:00:33	jibberjab	what class setup is basically from our notes
2013-12-08 21:00:52	@chance	jibberjab: did your instructor say how input is being given?
2013-12-08 21:01:04	jibberjab	http://i.imgur.com/HhT0RW3.png
2013-12-08 21:01:13	@chance	so from a file
2013-12-08 21:01:19	jibberjab	ya
2013-12-08 21:01:31	@chance	does the program need to handle an arbitrary number of books in the file:?
2013-12-08 21:02:43	jibberjab	yeah
2013-12-08 21:02:43	@chance	basically, you'll need to read the file line by line. you can use the getline function on the object.
2013-12-08 21:02:46	@chance	the file object
2013-12-08 21:02:49	@chance	i believe to do that
2013-12-08 21:02:58	@chance	so you'll iterate line by line, in sets of 3
2013-12-08 21:03:06	jibberjab	we have to make a writeData() function to write added objects to the file
2013-12-08 21:03:33	@chance	sorry 4,
2013-12-08 21:03:52	@chance	so you'l open a file, read 4 lines, store each line into a variable. Each set of 4 represents the books data.
2013-12-08 21:04:04	@chance	once you read each one into a variable, you can store them into your book object
2013-12-08 21:04:24	@chance	since you have a linked list for each book
2013-12-08 21:04:28	@chance	and each node is a pointer
2013-12-08 21:04:38	jibberjab	like right away i'm confused about how to do the setup to store the variables
2013-12-08 21:04:59	jibberjab	like do i need to do: new Book
2013-12-08 21:05:00	@chance	do you know how to read from files?
2013-12-08 21:05:38	jibberjab	my experience from C was to read in a file to an array and then set the different indexes to what i wanted
2013-12-08 21:06:10	jibberjab	if that makes sense
2013-12-08 21:06:13	@chance	that would work
2013-12-08 21:06:20	@chance	you dont have to do it any particular way
2013-12-08 21:06:31	@chance	you just need a place to store the results of 4 lines at a time
2013-12-08 21:07:33	-->	Gorjanc has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-08 21:07:52	@chance	so to start you'll have a while loop, and in that while loop you'll have a for loop which goes up to 4
2013-12-08 21:08:13	@chance	in that for loop you use getline() to read a line storing it into your array if thats your prefered method
2013-12-08 21:08:26	@chance	after you do that, yes you'll use new Book to make a new book object
2013-12-08 21:08:50	@chance	then use you setBlah methods to set its attributes you just read
2013-12-08 21:08:59	@chance	get to that point
2013-12-08 21:09:15	@chance	just make it so you can read the file, and store the contents into a book object

2013-12-08 21:15:51	jibberjab	am i following you correctly?
2013-12-08 21:16:43	@chance	that looks correct to me, but its been a long time since ive used C++, so double check it
2013-12-08 21:18:00	@chance	i think the types for the file and getline are wrong
2013-12-08 21:18:00	@chance	you have an ifstream and getline takes an istream...dont recall the difference.
2013-12-08 21:18:00	@chance	but they might work anyways
2013-12-08 21:19:06	jibberjab	can i just do fin >> title
2013-12-08 21:19:06	jibberjab	like that or something?
2013-12-08 21:19:07	@chance	idk
2013-12-08 21:28:02	jibberjab	i dont get any errors with >> except for string
2013-12-08 21:28:14	jibberjab	says no operator matches these types
2013-12-08 21:30:41	jesyspa	Well, getline(fin, bookId) definitely won't work.  getline works on strings, bookid is an int.
2013-12-08 21:30:44	jesyspa	And title is a char.
2013-12-08 21:33:21	jibberjab	oh, i changed title to string
2013-12-08 21:34:13	@chance	jesyspa: it acts on an istream, and an ifstream is an istream
2013-12-08 21:34:39	jibberjab	http://i.imgur.com/rvSc0Ga.png now it says getline is undefined?
2013-12-08 21:34:51	@chance	getline is inherited to ifstream objects via that

2013-12-09 13:36:38	darkf	:o
2013-12-09 13:36:42	tangentstorm	it just uses ascii instead of unicode online.

2013-12-09 13:36:51	darkf	the unicode look far nicer

2013-12-09 13:46:20	darkf	probably
2013-12-09 13:46:30	darkf	do any J impls optimize to cool SIMD instrs?
2013-12-09 13:46:45	tangentstorm	beats me i can't read the source code. :)
2013-12-09 13:46:50	darkf	hahahaha
2013-12-09 13:46:53	darkf	J is written in J?

2013-12-09 13:47:35	darkf	what the hell
2013-12-09 13:47:40	darkf	why do they write it that way
2013-12-09 13:47:56	tangentstorm	for the same reason they write j i guess.
2013-12-09 13:48:16	tangentstorm	it's how they think.
2013-12-09 13:48:16	darkf	they think without spaces or sane naming?
2013-12-09 13:48:26	darkf	throw it through astyle
2013-12-09 13:48:37	tangentstorm	no, they prefer it this way.
2013-12-09 13:48:53	darkf	their minds work very differently from mine then
2013-12-09 13:49:11	darkf	the problem is even their fucking filenames are obfuscated

2013-12-09 13:49:24	tangentstorm	i don't know.

2013-12-09 13:50:14	darkf	same

2013-12-09 13:50:21	tangentstorm	^ this was the original prototype for j
2013-12-09 13:51:00	tangentstorm	the guy who wrote it had implemented a couple different APL systems already.
2013-12-09 13:51:08	tangentstorm	(he made A+ for morgan stanley)
2013-12-09 13:51:15	tangentstorm	later went on to create K/Q
2013-12-09 13:51:22	darkf	how the fuck do these people debug
2013-12-09 13:51:42	darkf	oh whatever :P
2013-12-09 13:51:56	tangentstorm	he claims that this style makes it easier for him to not have bugs in the first place.
2013-12-09 13:52:11	darkf	suuuuuure...
2013-12-09 13:52:12	tangentstorm	he treats it like he's doing math.
2013-12-09 13:52:21	darkf	then why doesn't he write agda
2013-12-09 13:52:22	darkf	lord
2013-12-09 13:52:34	darkf	er, ATS
2013-12-09 13:52:35	tangentstorm	well this was written in like 1985
2013-12-09 13:52:42	darkf	agda is saner
2013-12-09 13:52:47	darkf	i see
2013-12-09 13:52:49	darkf	that makes more sense
2013-12-09 13:53:08	darkf	hrm they significantly updated the rust tutorial
2013-12-09 13:53:26	tangentstorm	anyway i worked through this code and rewrote (part of) it so would compile under clang.
2013-12-09 13:53:26	darkf	now if only they'd stop breaking the language (actually i think they froze syntax)
2013-12-09 13:53:27	darkf	(or maybe not)
2013-12-09 13:53:30	tangentstorm	here's my version: https://github.com/tangentstorm/j-incunabulum/blob/master/mj.c
2013-12-09 13:53:57	darkf	ok thats a bit nicer
2013-12-09 13:54:13	tangentstorm	it also doesn't do all the same things.
2013-12-09 13:54:13	darkf	again, I feel like deciphering J would be like observing the scrawlings of a dying madman
2013-12-09 13:54:34	tangentstorm	it's just a matter of learning to read it.
2013-12-09 13:55:12	darkf	then I have to learn what dyadic means eugh
2013-12-09 13:55:19	tangentstorm	infix binary.
2013-12-09 13:55:33	tangentstorm	2 + 2 <- dyadic.
2013-12-09 13:55:38	darkf	whats monadic then
2013-12-09 13:55:51	tangentstorm	prefix
2013-12-09 13:55:51	tangentstorm	+2
2013-12-09 13:55:51	darkf	what arity?

2013-12-09 13:56:12	tangentstorm	there are only three options

2013-12-09 13:56:57	darkf	ok so monadic, dyadic and adverbs
2013-12-09 13:57:01	tangentstorm	in j i mean.
2013-12-09 13:57:22	darkf	sounds like haskell.
2013-12-09 13:57:26	darkf	(1+) (+1) (1+1)
2013-12-09 13:57:40	tangentstorm	in j you would write those as

2013-12-09 23:28:44	Amadiro	ah
2013-12-09 23:29:29	SunFish	Another thing to talk about would be high-speed DSP code. Good luck fitting design patterns onto that.
2013-12-09 23:30:05	Amadiro	There are "design patterns" that do have zero runtime overhead
2013-12-09 23:31:13	SunFish	Generally they rely on modularization.
2013-12-09 23:31:30	SunFish	DSP code tends to blur that modularization for speed.

2013-12-11 09:40:36	@darkf	yes
2013-12-11 09:40:59	tangentstorm	it draws sprites on a canvas.
2013-12-11 09:40:59	tangentstorm	it works with a specific canvas api - the one provided by processing.org
2013-12-11 09:41:01	tangentstorm	but there are other canvas api's for java.
2013-12-11 09:41:13	tangentstorm	and for javascript too...
2013-12-11 09:41:47	tangentstorm	I might want to use it with OpenGL ES on android.
2013-12-11 09:41:52	@darkf	so you abstract the renderer. big deal.
2013-12-11 09:42:43	tangentstorm	okay.
2013-12-11 09:42:43	tangentstorm	so how should i do that?
2013-12-11 09:43:39	@darkf	in Java-OOPL land? make an IRenderer interface with all of the shit necessary. to make this easy, let's say your main canvas renderer is a singleton and when it gets instantiated it reads some configuration and instantiates the proper concrete renderer.
2013-12-11 09:45:05	tangentstorm	why do i need to read a configuration?
2013-12-11 09:45:15	@darkf	to know which renderer you want to use.
2013-12-11 09:45:24	@darkf	OpenGL, JS, AWT, whatever.
2013-12-11 09:45:36	tangentstorm	nah, i don't need that.
2013-12-11 09:45:57	@darkf	fine, there goes the IConfigurationParser and ConfigurationParserFactory etc
2013-12-11 09:47:15	tangentstorm	yeah, i didn't need either of those things.

2013-12-11 09:48:51	@darkf	so make a singleton IRenderer blah = new OpenGLRenderer();
2013-12-11 09:49:08	tangentstorm	yeah, that's pretty much how i approach it.
2013-12-11 09:49:15	tangentstorm	because my app itself is the container.
2013-12-11 09:51:43	@darkf	"and for a moment imagine a class which exposes a service which needs many more dependencies to be satisfied, which, in turn, have dependencies on other services. It would become a nightmare very fast. Here's where IoC and DI come to rescue.

2013-12-11 09:51:48	@darkf	hmm
2013-12-11 09:52:03	@darkf	but aren't i receiving the dependencies of THOSE?

2013-12-12 19:06:22	@tangentstorm	but it's just .... 0123456789abcdef ... find the index in that string for each character. multiply the first one by 16 and add the second one.

2013-12-12 19:08:54	marksist	What it is is (because I think that it is cool) when I find a new word in my kindle that I don't know I can highlight it. When I plug the kindle into my laptop the python script parses those words and then adds the words to a database that is (will be) available to review the new vocabulary.

2013-12-18 15:29:20	tangentstorm	LadyJiggles: if you've never done *any* programming, I made some videos that walk through the basic ideas, in a game-making context. it's not python but the ideas are all pretty basic and transfer over.
2013-12-18 15:29:45	tangentstorm	the videos, demos, code, etc are all here: http://gamesketchlib.org/
2013-12-18 15:29:57	LadyJiggles	I don`t think html/css/xml is programming
2013-12-18 15:30:04	LadyJiggles	and that`s all i have experience in
2013-12-18 15:30:29	LadyJiggles	thanks :D
2013-12-18 15:30:41	Metaleer	tangentstorm: What language is it? J? :P
2013-12-18 15:30:59	Metaleer	LadyJiggles: Most purists would agree; it's a Turing thing.
2013-12-18 15:31:02	tangentstorm	no those videos are in processing, which is like java
2013-12-18 15:31:19	Amadiro	HTML together with CSS is turing-complete
2013-12-18 15:31:21	Metaleer	I see.
2013-12-18 15:31:33	Metaleer	Amadiro: Together, but not separate, I guess.
2013-12-18 15:31:36	LadyJiggles	...what is turing?
2013-12-18 15:31:36	Amadiro	in the casual sense usually applied to languages
2013-12-18 15:31:47	Amadiro	Metaleer, well, you always use them together anyway.
2013-12-18 15:31:52	tangentstorm	turing was a person. alan turing.
2013-12-18 15:31:57	Metaleer	Amadiro: Also, it's curious because I think a part of TeX is Turing-complete.
2013-12-18 15:31:58	LadyJiggles	oh i know that name
2013-12-18 15:32:08	Metaleer	LadyJiggles: Ever heard of the Turing machine?
2013-12-18 15:32:11	Metaleer	LadyJiggles: It was his idea.
2013-12-18 15:32:18	LadyJiggles	oohhhh
2013-12-18 15:32:20	Amadiro	Metaleer, TeX is a full-blown programming language with conditionals and loops, yes
2013-12-18 15:32:29	Amadiro	I've never used a loop in TeX personally, but conditionals on various ocassions
2013-12-18 15:32:47	Metaleer	Amadiro: Yeah, me neither. I just it for making kick-ass PDFs. :-)
2013-12-18 15:33:02	Metaleer	use*
2013-12-18 15:33:09	Amadiro	well, loops can probably be useful if you do something like automatic table creation or so
2013-12-18 15:33:32	Metaleer	That's one thing I hate about TeX; the tables. That, and its image placement algorithms.
2013-12-18 15:33:37	Metaleer	Makes you want to murder it
2013-12-18 15:33:38	Metaleer	.
2013-12-18 15:34:08	Amadiro	I use csv2latex or whatever it was called
2013-12-18 15:34:23	Amadiro	it has a lot of nice options and will style your table for you
2013-12-18 15:34:34	Metaleer	I see.
2013-12-18 15:34:36	tangentstorm	i doubt knuth even had a graphical display on his machine when he made tex.
2013-12-18 15:34:44	Metaleer	lol
2013-12-18 15:35:00	Amadiro	tangentstorm, depends, do you count a printer as a "graphical display"?
2013-12-18 15:35:20	tangentstorm	no i meant a realtime one, and that he probably had to print everything out to see how it looked.
2013-12-18 15:35:33	Amadiro	maybe, no idea
2013-12-18 15:35:39	tangentstorm	it's pretty old.
2013-12-18 15:35:41	Metaleer	Amadiro: Oh, I know you.
2013-12-18 15:35:45	Amadiro	do you
2013-12-18 15:35:51	tangentstorm	old enough that it was written in pascal. :)

2013-12-18 15:36:08	Amadiro	Metaleer, yeah, I'm in 64-odd channels on freenode
2013-12-18 15:36:12	Metaleer	So I see.
2013-12-18 15:36:46	tangentstorm	what, you're 64-timing us, Amadiro? but we're still your favorite, right? :D

2013-12-18 15:40:10	Metaleer	Where x is a four-digit natural number.

2013-12-18 15:50:53	tangentstorm	you'd just take a sequence of cube numers, multiply them by themselves to make a square table, cut off the duplicate results at the diagonal,  self classify the results to find duplicate sums... then just keep increasing the length of the original list until you find an answer that has 4 digits.

2013-12-27 16:57:59	Kelet	Yeah, it's really nice.
2013-12-27 16:58:06	tangentstorm	do you have to actually type the markdown though?
2013-12-27 16:58:55	Kelet	Yeah, it's not WYSIWYG, but it has a nice preview pane, automatic completion, and you can use menus to help you
2013-12-27 16:59:10	Kelet	I was mostly looking for a preview pane
2013-12-27 16:59:24	tangentstorm	huh. interesting.
2013-12-27 17:00:10	Kelet	http://badnotes.com/static/images/haroopad.png
2013-12-27 17:00:24	Kelet	What you write is to the left - then instant preview on the right. Of course you can use menu/autocompletion to help write on the left
2013-12-27 17:00:38	Kelet	I primarily needed it for writing nice markdown files for GitHub and such
2013-12-27 17:00:43	Kelet	But it can export to HTML or print
2013-12-27 17:00:58	tangentstorm	i think i was spoiled by my first computer
2013-12-27 17:01:02	Kelet	I just tend to write markdown improperly my first go. I upload it to GitHub, realize it has some messup, and then have to recommit
2013-12-27 17:01:53	tangentstorm	i had asked my parents for a word processor, not a computer, because a simple home computer was like $2000
2013-12-27 17:02:22	tangentstorm	anyway they bought me a computer with wordperfect
2013-12-27 17:02:27	Kelet	A dedicated word processing machine? What's the difference between that and a computer?
2013-12-27 17:02:47	Kelet	Locked down with a proprietary OS, and weaker hardware?
2013-12-27 17:02:48	tangentstorm	it was like a typewriter
2013-12-27 17:02:53	Kelet	Ah, that :)
2013-12-27 17:02:58	 *	Kelet is only in his mid 20s
2013-12-27 17:02:59	tangentstorm	but it had like one or two lines of led display
2013-12-27 17:03:13	tangentstorm	lcd
2013-12-27 17:03:21	Kelet	http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Hardwarewordprocessor.png
2013-12-27 17:03:22	tangentstorm	maybe more than that, i don't know
2013-12-27 17:03:24	Kelet	Oh kind of like that?
2013-12-27 17:03:53	tangentstorm	yes! that may very well have been the exact model i had
2013-12-27 17:04:01	Kelet	haha
2013-12-27 17:04:11	Kelet	So you could edit the few lines before it goes onto the page?
2013-12-27 17:04:15	Kelet	That seems very useful for the time
2013-12-27 17:04:39	tangentstorm	i don't know how/why i actually got the word processor since they bought me the computer... or what happened to it... but i had one for a while
2013-12-27 17:05:04	tangentstorm	you could edit a whole book on there, but you couldn't run arbitrary software.
2013-12-27 17:05:15	tangentstorm	just that one program.
2013-12-27 17:05:30	tangentstorm	and it had the built-in printer (dot matrix i assume)

2013-12-27 17:06:21	tangentstorm	anyway that would have cost like $300 or so compared to $2000 for a 386
2013-12-27 17:07:16	tangentstorm	this was... 1991 or so
2013-12-27 17:08:10	tangentstorm	anyway.... the point of all that was that wordperfect was awesome. it was just an 80x25 dos screne but it had italics and underlines and bold and whatnot.
2013-12-27 17:08:38	tangentstorm	you could do some fiddling with bios to make that happen somehow
2013-12-27 17:09:09	tangentstorm	it wasn't WYSIWYG .. more like syntax highlighting.
2013-12-27 17:09:30	tangentstorm	you could make outlines and put in-document hyperlinks
2013-12-27 17:09:38	tangentstorm	and tables
2013-12-27 17:09:54	tangentstorm	so the document's internal structure was very much like an html document.
2013-12-27 17:10:20	tangentstorm	and you could press a button (f11 i think) that was mapped to the command 'reveal codes'
2013-12-27 17:10:46	tangentstorm	and it would split the screen so that you'd have the pretty stuff at the top and some html-like markup at the bottom
2013-12-27 17:11:06	tangentstorm	well it was more like a rendering of the dom-like structure.
2013-12-27 17:11:22	Kelet	interesting
2013-12-27 17:11:32	tangentstorm	almost exactly like what you get in a browser when you inspect the dom, except the input cursor for the text and the 'dom' were synced
2013-12-27 17:12:02	Kelet	Seems like some of the older software had ideas that transcend even today
2013-12-27 17:12:25	tangentstorm	so if you somehow wound up with the equivalent of   <u>hello world </u>    and you wanted to remove the underline from the trailing space, you could go into reveal codes and correct little things like that.
2013-12-27 17:12:38	tangentstorm	and then otherwise you never had to mess with it.
2013-12-27 17:13:37	tangentstorm	the only thing i've used in modern times that compares to that is /maybe/ dreamweaver, but dw's not really geared toward word processing.

2013-12-28 14:04:00	-->	okinomo has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-28 14:05:20	darkf	can you not compile the same file?
2013-12-28 14:06:03	am11	we can compile but there is something extra being done by icedcoffeescript
2013-12-28 14:06:39	darkf	well i thought that was the point. what extra is it doing?
2013-12-28 14:06:56	am11	the icedcoffeescript treats deffarls differently, while coffeescript keep them intact
2013-12-28 14:07:05	am11	here is the snafu, i am dealing with: https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials2013/issues/320
2013-12-28 14:07:58	am11	in this^ situation, do you think we need both compilers, or icedcoffeescript would suffice?
2013-12-28 14:09:53	darkf	well as ghorsey says you can switch to async/await (which is nicer anyway) or maybe you could use literal JS with ``? or some other way of calling defer?
2013-12-28 14:11:43	-->	mizu_no_oto has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-28 14:11:44	am11	the async/await is caused by icedcoffeescript compiler... whenever it seeks and finds defer keyword, it replace it with its own asynchrony framework..
2013-12-28 14:12:12	darkf	yes, so use literal JS, find another way to call defer, or use iced's async/await which is probably the point of using iced
2013-12-28 14:12:29	am11	i assumed there must be a switch to make icedcoffeescript compiler act like a coffeescript compiler..
2013-12-28 14:14:24	darkf	doesnt look like it
2013-12-28 14:14:54	darkf	plus i thought redux was the project to make coffeescript better
2013-12-28 14:14:54	darkf	oh well
2013-12-28 14:14:55	am11	darkf: the coffeescript compiler doesn't do anything when it finds defer() call.. i guess this is what ghorsey is asking.

2013-12-28 17:27:52	Amadiro	tangentstorm, I'm trying to understand why the heimholtz reciprocity holds for physically based BRDFs, but I can't really figure it out
2013-12-28 17:28:09	Amadiro	it's easy to imagine a surface that violates heimholtz but still follows the laws of energy conservation
2013-12-28 17:28:27	Amadiro	But it also says "When there are magnetic fields or optically active materials in the path of the ray, the principle does not apply in its simple form."
2013-12-28 17:28:36	Amadiro	so maybe the material I'm thinking of would count as "optically active"
2013-12-28 17:28:37	Amadiro	no idea
2013-12-28 17:28:41	Merryleer	I was reading through your article and it seems like a fascinating question, but unfortunately I'm a bit tied up with Christmas-related activities. :-(

2013-12-28 17:30:28	Amadiro	(iridescence violates heimholtz unless the BRDF is rotationally symmetric around the surface normal, which led my to the question "well, why would it be?")

When I have an object in a class and check whether it is null in the constructor (and assign a value to it), will it be null for the second object I create from that class?

2013-12-28 19:47:11	tangentstorm	Merryleer: no idea what that's in reference to, but if you want to make QT guis without the headaches, try http://lazarus.freepascal.org/
2013-12-28 19:47:21	Merryleer	Amadiro: Yeah, like that.
2013-12-28 19:47:23	Merryleer	Dreeass: :-)
2013-12-28 19:47:25	Merryleer	tangentstorm: Hm.
2013-12-28 19:47:27	Amadiro	Merryleer, what's a hassle about that?
2013-12-28 19:47:27	Merryleer	Let's see.
2013-12-28 19:47:41	Amadiro	Merryleer, qts build system even takes care of all of that for you automatically, if you let it
2013-12-28 19:47:48	Merryleer	Hm.
2013-12-28 19:48:08	Merryleer	Amadiro: I see.
2013-12-28 19:48:08	tangentstorm	some people have complained to me that pascal is too verbose and that j is too terse... so today i'm making a pascal metaprogramming system in j... :)
2013-12-28 19:48:10	Merryleer	"Rapid Application Development"
2013-12-28 19:48:29	RRR2	holy crap what
2013-12-28 19:48:34	Amadiro	for gtk you just do "pkg-config --libs --cflags gtk+-2.0" for instance
2013-12-28 19:48:43	Amadiro	and link your program with whatever that outputs
2013-12-28 19:48:52	Merryleer	Amadiro: Yeah, that is specifically what seemed like a chore to me.
2013-12-28 19:49:08	Amadiro	Merryleer, it's a natural part of developing any native program, really
2013-12-28 19:49:18	Amadiro	OR bindings for a different language like python
2013-12-28 19:49:18	Merryleer	Amadiro: I see.
2013-12-28 19:49:31	Merryleer	Hm, I've heard of RADs before, Rapid Application Development.
2013-12-28 19:49:33	Amadiro	the library still has to come from somewhere, after all
2013-12-28 19:49:34	Merryleer	I need to look into it.
2013-12-28 19:50:47	Amadiro	A more important criteria when chosing a language to create a GUI application is 1) how easy is it to pack the program up into a self-contained bundle that the user can run? and 2) what toolkits are available for the language, and what quality do the bindings have?
2013-12-28 19:50:58	Amadiro	e.g. python has Qt bindings, but they lag a good year-or-so behind the C++ Qt bindings
2013-12-28 19:51:00	Merryleer	I see.
2013-12-28 19:51:04	Merryleer	That sounds like good advice.

2013-12-28 19:59:25	tangentstorm	lots
2013-12-28 19:59:29	tangentstorm	it's terrible for metaprogramming
2013-12-28 19:59:36	tangentstorm	or for use as a thinking tool
2013-12-28 20:00:00	jesyspa	"thinking tool"?
2013-12-28 20:00:53	tangentstorm	yeah. you can't really just sit down and think through simple problems in pascal the way you can in python or j or haskell or whatever
2013-12-28 20:01:11	tangentstorm	like there's no repl, and if there were one it would be terrible :D
2013-12-28 20:01:54	tangentstorm	basically i use pascal where other people use C/c++ and for most other things I use python and now, lately, j
2013-12-28 20:02:14	tangentstorm	oh and i use coffeescript for browser stuff
2013-12-28 20:02:42	tangentstorm	you can actually write j code on paper and manipulate it like you would an algebraic formula.
2013-12-28 20:02:53	jesyspa	Huh, I wasn't aware Pascal had the performance of C++.
2013-12-28 20:03:03	tangentstorm	i tried doing that yesterday with python and it was horrendous
2013-12-28 20:04:13	<--	soobus has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2013-12-28 20:04:18	tangentstorm	well, fpc doesn't do quite as many optimizations as gcc or clang, but it does generate native code. and you can drop down into assembly if you need to
2013-12-28 20:04:53	tangentstorm	it can also generate code for the jvm
2013-12-28 20:04:59	harso	Mind if I link my reddit thread? I need a hand

2013-12-28 20:07:11	harso	with*
2013-12-28 20:07:20	Kelet	Then learn Swing or JavaFX
2013-12-28 20:07:23	Kelet	for making GUIs
2013-12-28 20:07:30	Amadiro	swing is not very good, IMO
2013-12-28 20:07:35	harso	Why is that?
2013-12-28 20:08:02	Amadiro	it's API is badly designed/structured, and it looks and feels bad (on all platforms) and performs slow
2013-12-28 20:08:08	<--	hassen_ has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
2013-12-28 20:08:22	harso	Seems to be a popular choice from what I've seen haha
2013-12-28 20:08:35	Amadiro	harso, that's because it's the only thing you're allowed to use inside applets and such.
2013-12-28 20:08:47	harso	i see
2013-12-28 20:08:55	Amadiro	But if you want to create a desktop app, maybe look into Qt Jambi
2013-12-28 20:08:59	Amadiro	which is Qt for java.
2013-12-28 20:09:07	harso	I've seen Qt, interesting
2013-12-28 20:09:17	harso	I think I just need to go a little more in depth with what I'm learning
2013-12-28 20:09:21	Kelet	harso: Different people have different preferences: Swing isn't a problem for me
2013-12-28 20:09:28	Kelet	Try things yourself and see I suppose
2013-12-28 20:09:32	Kelet	JavaFX can make fancy GUIs, though
2013-12-28 20:09:36	harso	Yeah, it's a matter of trial and error

2013-12-28 20:23:33	-->	trustyhank has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-28 20:26:50	Kelet	Dreeass: Generally you 'lex' the source code into tokens (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Tokenization), then you take the tokens and make sure they are 'grammatically correct' (meaning the syntax is working), and then you convert the tokens into 'actions' so to speak
2013-12-28 20:26:55	tangentstorm	Dreeass: that's a big question. :) you can make a simple language in a few lines.
2013-12-28 20:27:08	Kelet	Dreeass: But that's a very very high level overview and there are alternate ways that involve similar concepts
2013-12-28 20:27:26	Dreeass	Kelet, tangentstorm. What in the actual f*.

2013-12-28 20:28:08	tangentstorm	it's a channel about learning :)
2013-12-28 20:28:20	tangentstorm	that's what learning feels like... :)
2013-12-28 20:28:41	 *	Dreeass his mind has been blown.
2013-12-28 20:29:17	--	timshoaf is now known as timshoaf|away
2013-12-28 20:29:36	tangentstorm	in the language i'm learning (j), there's a tokenizer built in as a primitive word.
2013-12-28 20:29:47	tangentstorm	so it actually makes a pretty good demo
2013-12-28 20:30:03	Dreeass	I don't even know what a tokenizer is
2013-12-28 20:30:38	tangentstorm	a simple language would have very little syntax. if you want to say   "2 + 2 * 3" it's complicated, because is that  "(2 + 2) * 3"  or  "2 + (2 * 3)" ?
2013-12-28 20:31:10	Dreeass	Even the programming language has to know how to interpret that?
2013-12-28 20:31:15	tangentstorm	sure
2013-12-28 20:31:24	Dreeass	Wow, it's way more complicated than I thought.
2013-12-28 20:31:25	tangentstorm	and the answer is different in different languages
2013-12-28 20:31:59	Dreeass	Python for example, how is that written?
2013-12-28 20:32:16	tangentstorm	well it's a big c program :)
2013-12-28 20:32:29	Dreeass	So it's C code that interprets text?
2013-12-28 20:33:03	Dreeass	How is C written then? In assembly?
2013-12-28 20:33:08	tangentstorm	in c
2013-12-28 20:33:18	Dreeass	C is written in C?
2013-12-28 20:33:21	tangentstorm	the original was probably written in something else
2013-12-28 20:33:26	Kelet	There's something called bootstrapping where you implement part of a language in say, assembly
2013-12-28 20:33:29	-->	beardtree has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-28 20:33:34	Kelet	And then the rest of the language in that part of the language
2013-12-28 20:34:07	tangentstorm	yeah, or you could write an interpreter for the language in some other language, then write a compiler in the language and run it on the interpreter. :)
2013-12-28 20:34:34	tangentstorm	the interpreter then compiles the compiler, and then the compiler can compile itself
2013-12-28 20:34:46	Dreeass	So you do the base in assembly for example and based of that you write code that is interpreted by itself?
2013-12-28 20:34:55	Dreeass	Codeception!
2013-12-28 20:35:04	tangentstorm	that's just one way, but yeah.
2013-12-28 20:35:06	Kelet	You can implement a subset of C, it's not quite C but it implements the basics
2013-12-28 20:35:11	Kelet	Then from there, implement the rest of C
2013-12-28 20:35:16	Kelet	And indeed, that is one way
2013-12-28 20:35:16	beardtree	The very first compiler was written in machine code
2013-12-28 20:35:27	tangentstorm	there's a python implementation in python. c and clang are written in c. free pascal is written in free pascal. haskell is written in haskell.
2013-12-28 20:35:44	tangentstorm	j is written in c but they went out of their way to make the c look like j :)
2013-12-28 20:36:01	Dreeass	This it too much for me
2013-12-28 20:36:05	tangentstorm	er i meant ghc (the main haskell compiler) is written in haskell
2013-12-28 20:36:12	harso	Any freelancers here?
2013-12-28 20:36:27	Dreeass	Depends actually
2013-12-28 20:36:28	tangentstorm	Dreeass: the simplest language i can think of is called forth. it's usually written in assembly language
2013-12-28 20:36:38	jesyspa	Er, what.
2013-12-28 20:36:38	tangentstorm	<- expensive freelancer :)
2013-12-28 20:36:45	jesyspa	There are far simpler things.
2013-12-28 20:36:57	jesyspa	The untyped lambda calculus, to begin with.
2013-12-28 20:37:01	harso	Haha, best part of it
2013-12-28 20:37:02	Dreeass	tangentstorm, I don't even know where to start with all of my questions
2013-12-28 20:37:29	Dreeass	Where is the basic of C based off then?
2013-12-28 20:37:33	beardtree	Nowadays even interpreters compile code
2013-12-28 20:37:38	beardtree	Those are called JITs
2013-12-28 20:37:48	beardtree	They load blocks code to interpret and compile them on the fly
2013-12-28 20:38:09	tangentstorm	okay i meant the simplest real programming language :) yes, there's lambda calculus and ski and brainfuck
2013-12-28 20:38:12	harso	C was an enhancement of B
2013-12-28 20:38:39	tangentstorm	dijkstra has a pretty neat little imperative language with only two control structures (both of which were nondeterministic)
2013-12-28 20:38:57	harso	i remember studying dijkstra's algorithm in maths

2013-12-28 20:50:32	Dreeass	harso, nah. That's not really interesting me, I'd rather be programming. I really don't like maths all that much, I like problem solving.
2013-12-28 20:50:50	harso	I suppose it's all in the 'doing' haha
2013-12-28 20:51:02	harso	that's the problem with universities, they promote theory too much
2013-12-28 20:51:09	Dreeass	Not here
2013-12-28 20:51:15	harso	really?
2013-12-28 20:51:34	<--	RRR2 has quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
2013-12-28 20:51:35	Dreeass	There are like 2 different types of bachelor (that's what we call it but it has nothing to do with a wedding thing)
2013-12-28 20:51:57	harso	Bachelor of arts, bachelor of science?
2013-12-28 20:52:02	harso	BSc, BA
2013-12-28 20:52:11	Dreeass	One is focused on theory and the other part is mainly focused on practicing it.
2013-12-28 20:52:22	Dreeass	I have no idea.
2013-12-28 20:52:26	harso	Ah I see
2013-12-28 20:52:37	Amadiro	harso, it entirely depends on the university, really. Mine has a fairly applied focus, when it comes to the IT department.
2013-12-28 20:52:54	harso	That's good
2013-12-28 20:53:01	harso	Cambridge tend to focus on academics
2013-12-28 20:53:08	harso	Not so much what is made
2013-12-28 20:53:35	Dreeass	I've tried some stuff  with Arduino but found that it wasn't really my pick. I preferred programming, mostly because it was quite costly.
2013-12-28 20:53:58	harso	Arduino, you have to constantly buy lots of addons and things
2013-12-28 20:54:06	Dreeass	harso, exactly!
2013-12-28 20:54:06	Amadiro	you don't really have to buy anything
2013-12-28 20:54:10	 *	tangentstorm is thinking about getting one
2013-12-28 20:54:15	Amadiro	you can repurpose an old radio or whatever to get the parts
2013-12-28 20:54:21	Dreeass	tangentstorm, be prepared to pay  a lot of stuff.
2013-12-28 20:54:27	harso	haha
2013-12-28 20:54:30	Amadiro	and you can get arduino clones for supercheap
2013-12-28 20:54:36	harso	Really?
2013-12-28 20:54:40	harso	Find me one. NOW.
2013-12-28 20:54:40	harso	Haha
2013-12-28 20:54:41	Dreeass	Amadiro, trust me. I have gotten a lot of stuff from old stuff.
2013-12-28 20:54:48	Amadiro	harso, there are literally millions on the internet
2013-12-28 20:54:51	Amadiro	the arduino is an open design
2013-12-28 20:54:55	Amadiro	so anybody is allowed to clone it
2013-12-28 20:54:55	Dreeass	Then it's like: "Shit I need this."
2013-12-28 20:55:02	harso	I've played around with the Raspberry Pi
2013-12-28 20:55:09	Dreeass	Then I have to go buy it, same harso.
2013-12-28 20:55:13	Amadiro	I've personally used the teensy 2.0 in various projects
2013-12-28 20:55:17	Amadiro	I think it's quite good
2013-12-28 20:55:23	Amadiro	it's also arduino compatible
2013-12-28 20:55:25	Dreeass	I'm using it for movies and stuff currently and deploying Android apk's.
2013-12-28 20:55:45	Amadiro	And really, electronic components don't cost much, even if you want to buy them new...
2013-12-28 20:55:45	harso	Damn
2013-12-28 20:55:50	Dreeass	Amadiro, we don't a job -> can't afford all of this shit.
2013-12-28 20:56:00	harso	Dreeass, go freelance
2013-12-28 20:56:02	Dreeass	Amadiro, it costs to ship them.
2013-12-28 20:56:04	harso	Get some cash
2013-12-28 20:56:15	Amadiro	Dreeass, shipping from mouser.com costs a few bucks
2013-12-28 20:56:29	Dreeass	harso, I'm currently working on a company with my brother to sell websites with a custom framework.
2013-12-28 20:56:42	Dreeass	First site is finished: cloock.eu
2013-12-28 20:56:44	-->	Nickel has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-28 20:56:47	Dreeass	It's a test domain
2013-12-28 20:56:49	Amadiro	electronics is pretty much one of the cheapest hobbies you can have, IMO, and unless you live in a 3rd world country, totally affordable
2013-12-28 20:57:00	Amadiro	compare to almost any other hobby
2013-12-28 20:57:03	harso	No need for custom framework
2013-12-28 20:57:11	Dreeass	You can check it out, there's a lot going on behind the scenes and it's Dutch. There is a control panel, file sharing for certain stuff.
2013-12-28 20:57:12	harso	I used to sell wordpress sites for £400+
2013-12-28 20:57:31	Dreeass	harso, it's just a backend. We only need to edit the frontend for a new website.
2013-12-28 20:57:35	harso	Ah ok
2013-12-28 20:58:11	Dreeass	harso, if we have all of the modules (things we can add) available for a requested site. Then we only have to do design and the domain.
2013-12-28 20:58:39	Nickel	Hey can you find out the dimensions of a video by looking at its hex?
2013-12-28 20:58:48	Amadiro	yes
2013-12-28 20:59:12	harso	Cool
2013-12-28 20:59:13	Nickel	That's interesting, what do you look at? Is there a specific place?
2013-12-28 20:59:21	Amadiro	Nickel, yes, the header.
2013-12-28 20:59:32	Amadiro	but you need to know and understand the video format and possibly codec
2013-12-28 20:59:33	tangentstorm	try looking in the ffmpeg library to see how it does it. (or just use ffmpeg)

2013-12-28 20:59:39	Dreeass	Amadiro, for example what Nickel is asking. I'd like to be taught all of that stuff and I'm not sure whether the IT college thing is going to teach me that.
2013-12-28 20:59:40	tangentstorm	(not sure i'm remembering the name right)
2013-12-28 20:59:44	harso	Dreeass, what I used to do was just use themeforest, buy a theme for them and customise it (if they needed anything else)
2013-12-28 21:00:01	Amadiro	Dreeass, sounds like you want an SE degree or so.
2013-12-28 21:00:02	Dreeass	harso, I've never used Wordpress.
2013-12-28 21:00:09	Amadiro	Dreeass, talk to your advisor
2013-12-28 21:00:10	harso	It's pretty simple to use
2013-12-28 21:00:11	Dreeass	Amadiro, SE?
2013-12-28 21:00:15	Amadiro	software engineering
2013-12-28 21:00:56	tangentstorm	the truth is most of the day to day programming jobs in the world don't require much advanced computer science.
2013-12-28 21:01:09	harso	not at all, haha
2013-12-28 21:01:10	Dreeass	Amadiro, the problem is that in my country you first need to go through a basic course of 1 year all about the standard stuff about engineering: chemistry and the other stuff I don't need. It's too hard for me.
2013-12-28 21:01:12	Amadiro	well, entirely depends on how you set your ambitions
2013-12-28 21:01:21	Amadiro	being a garbage truck driver doesn't require a lot of math either
2013-12-28 21:01:30	Nickel	Amadiro: Oh I see. The video is .mp4
2013-12-28 21:01:30	Amadiro	if you want to be a garbage truck driver, feel free to skip the math
2013-12-28 21:02:11	Dreeass	Amadiro, so what are you saying?
2013-12-28 21:02:16	tangentstorm	i'm not saying don't study cs... just that there's a huge number of jobs where the work is mostly pretty boring stuff
2013-12-28 21:02:38	Amadiro	Dreeass, I'm saying that it's probably not a great idea to consider "the average programmer" to be the goal to aspire to
2013-12-28 21:02:47	 *	tangentstorm agrees 100%
2013-12-28 21:02:57	Amadiro	because whatever you aim for, you'll probably fall at least a little bit short
2013-12-28 21:03:03	Amadiro	so if you're aiming for average programmer
2013-12-28 21:03:06	Amadiro	you'll just be a sub-par one
2013-12-28 21:03:08	-->	Gorjanc has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-28 21:03:09	Dreeass	Amadiro, then what should I aim for?
2013-12-28 21:03:14	harso	Over-genius
2013-12-28 21:03:15	Amadiro	how would I know
2013-12-28 21:03:18	harso	Mastermind
2013-12-28 21:03:33	Amadiro	maybe you want to work on interesting stuff
2013-12-28 21:03:38	Amadiro	physics simulations, earth quake predictions
2013-12-28 21:03:46	Amadiro	real-time stuff, embedded programming
2013-12-28 21:03:47	harso	I want to be a quant
2013-12-28 21:03:48	Amadiro	medicinal devices
2013-12-28 21:03:55	Dreeass	Amadiro, I don't even know what I could do...
2013-12-28 21:04:05	Amadiro	well, figure it out, then
2013-12-28 21:04:10	harso	Freelance is great, freelance quantitative analyst
2013-12-28 21:04:16	Dreeass	Amadiro, where could I go when I leave college? I have no fucking idea.
2013-12-28 21:04:27	harso	Anywhere
2013-12-28 21:04:29	tangentstorm	Dreeass: well start with something simple. you think chemistry is too hard for you. why not start by making a program to model chemical equations?
2013-12-28 21:04:36	harso	Depends on your skills
2013-12-28 21:05:02	tangentstorm	Dreeass: er, i didn't mean start with a simple problem, because that's actually a pretty hard problem. i meant start with something right in front of you.
2013-12-28 21:05:04	Dreeass	tangentstorm, I'm not talking about basic chemistry. I'm talking about advanced chemistry.
2013-12-28 21:05:15	Amadiro	Dreeass, I don't know you, I can't tell you what/where you want to be and what you need to learn to get there
2013-12-28 21:05:44	harso	Become your own learner, self-directed learning will get you ahead of every other person out there
2013-12-28 21:06:00	harso	Following a college course will only make you as good as the rest of them
2013-12-28 21:06:06	Amadiro	but if you want to be an average or sub-par programmer... feel free to skip the CS and math :D
2013-12-28 21:06:09	Dreeass	harso, I think it's best to go to one of those expositions and see what suits me best.
2013-12-28 21:06:11	Amadiro	harso, bullshit
2013-12-28 21:06:21	Amadiro	following a college course *is* self-learning
2013-12-28 21:06:25	tangentstorm	Dreeass: so think of a specific problem from advanced chemistry that you think is too hard and just try to solve it with programming.
2013-12-28 21:06:28	Amadiro	you don't get information spoon-fed at college anymore
2013-12-28 21:06:32	harso	But you're studying for the same stuff
2013-12-28 21:06:34	Amadiro	but you do get an opportunity to put your knowledge to the test
2013-12-28 21:06:37	Amadiro	treat it as such
2013-12-28 21:06:37	harso	Same outcome
2013-12-28 21:06:52	Amadiro	there is nothing that prevents you from excelling and going beyond the subject to any degree you can
2013-12-28 21:07:11	harso	Sure, but what would that require Amadiro
2013-12-28 21:07:16	Dreeass	tangentstorm, I have no idea how I would begin to do that.
2013-12-28 21:07:17	Amadiro	work
2013-12-28 21:07:21	Amadiro	a lot of hard work
2013-12-28 21:07:44	Amadiro	and -- unsurprisingly -- if you're self-studying and not putting a lot of hard work into it, you're not going anywhere either
2013-12-28 21:07:44	tangentstorm	Dreeass: me either. i have no idea how to write a pascal compiler in j. guess what i'm doing today?
2013-12-28 21:07:45	harso	But if I studied Python for example, for a year with the same students with the same degree course to follow - who would come out different
2013-12-28 21:07:52	Dreeass	Amadiro, I'd love to do programming for a company for example. But will I like it? What will I like?
2013-12-28 21:07:53	Amadiro	(although you may succeed in fooling yourself into thinking that you do)
2013-12-28 21:08:15	harso	I'm talking about learning different things
2013-12-28 21:08:33	Amadiro	harso, if you want to learn different things, maybe you're attending the wrong course?
2013-12-28 21:08:34	harso	If all students follow one program requiring them to learn the same things, they will come out the same
2013-12-28 21:08:49	harso	different things in relation to the subject
2013-12-28 21:08:52	Amadiro	no, because most students will only absorb 50% of the course material
2013-12-28 21:08:56	Dreeass	I would just love to go to college for just one day to see what it's like on day one.

2013-12-28 21:09:50	Dreeass	Gosh
2013-12-28 21:09:59	Amadiro	However, the reason most college courses exist and are the way they are is because 1) they bundle a set of useful information and related facts that you probably want to know (that's why you're attending the course in the first place) and 2) are set up such that you'll have more than enough work to fill your day, if you want to
2013-12-28 21:10:05	Dreeass	You're all from America besides Harso?
2013-12-28 21:10:14	Amadiro	if you *still* have time beyond that, well, feel free to learn whatever additional things you can cram into your brain
2013-12-28 21:10:21	Amadiro	Dreeass, no (check the hostmask)
2013-12-28 21:10:47	harso	Lol, the only reason a higher education course exists for me is purely for the cv value
2013-12-28 21:11:04	Dreeass	Amadiro, wow from Budapest.
2013-12-28 21:11:04	Amadiro	well, then you're clearly attending the wrong course
2013-12-28 21:11:18	Amadiro	Dreeass, me? nope
2013-12-28 21:11:24	harso	I'm interested, but I've learnt it already
2013-12-28 21:11:33	harso	Because I'm an autodidact

2013-12-28 21:11:51	Amadiro	you need to look at my hostmask
2013-12-28 21:12:08	Amadiro	harso, then score an A in the course, use the extra free time you have to learn something more, and move on

2013-12-28 21:14:07	harso	A person who learns outside of the time, would score so much more right?
2013-12-28 21:14:19	Amadiro	the average student scores a C on the tests, that's how the system works
2013-12-28 21:14:23	harso	On top of inside of class, of course
2013-12-28 21:14:48	Amadiro	harso, maybe, maybe not. That depends on how relevant the extra stuff you've learned is to the class, and how much work you've put into it

2013-12-28 21:20:51	harso	In my first year I study 2 programming languages
2013-12-28 21:21:05	harso	In other countries, I have no idea
2013-12-28 21:21:09	Amadiro	Dreeass, depends on what you're studying and which languages
2013-12-28 21:21:21	harso	We just study the logic
2013-12-28 21:21:22	Dreeass	harso, how deep do you get into them?
2013-12-28 21:21:30	Amadiro	There are some programming languages that you can learn for 5 years and still only have scratched the surface, really
2013-12-28 21:21:33	harso	Basics, absolute basics
2013-12-28 21:21:59	harso	Then we look at mathematics, and it's mainly in the 3rd year we go deep into the languages
2013-12-28 21:22:05	Dreeass	I see on a diagram that in the first semestre of college in what I'd like to study they focus on Java. But I think that'll be easy for me.

2013-12-28 21:42:35	Nickel	For example if it's 640x640, then this is the one I want. Otherwise ignore it.
2013-12-28 21:42:52	-->	RRR2 has joined #learnprogramming
2013-12-28 21:43:34	Amadiro	Nickel, you can either store the data you've already gotten and run something like ffmpeg over it (it will probably tell you somehow) -- that'd be the easy way
2013-12-28 21:43:44	Amadiro	otherwise use libav or so to parse the format and extract the information
2013-12-28 21:43:47	Amadiro	or do it all yourself
2013-12-28 21:43:57	Amadiro	the latter two option probably require that you know exactly what format you're getting
2013-12-28 21:44:32	Nickel	The format will definitely always be .mp4
2013-12-28 21:44:54	Nickel	But the dimensions are the only thing that may vary.
2013-12-28 21:45:10	Nickel	I'll look into what you just suggest.
2013-12-28 21:46:12	Nickel	When you say "do it all yourself" what does that entail?
2013-12-28 21:46:41	Amadiro	parsing the header of the format you're receiving
2013-12-28 21:47:02	Nickel	Oh right, what am I parsing for exactly?
2013-12-28 21:47:41	Amadiro	Nickel, what you are getting is probably mpeg-4 part 14
2013-12-28 21:47:58	Amadiro	but there are different versions of it as well
2013-12-28 21:48:04	Amadiro	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14
2013-12-28 21:48:07	Nickel	I'm getting: MPEG4-GENERIC/48
2013-12-28 21:48:15	Nickel	and: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec
2013-12-28 21:49:05	Nickel	I'm assuming H.246 would be what I'm looking?
2013-12-28 21:49:26	Amadiro	you probably don't need to look into the actual codec, the container format will probably have the information you want in the header
2013-12-28 21:50:16	Nickel	Hey Amadiro did you get anything for Christmas?

2013-12-28 21:53:45	Nickel	Amadiro: How does one know when the header starts and begins when looking at the hex? Is it always a specific range of lines?
2013-12-28 21:54:02	Amadiro	Nickel, the header starts with the first byte of the data stream
2013-12-28 21:54:14	Amadiro	you need to read the specification to figure out what it looks like and how long it is
2013-12-28 21:54:20	RRR2	nickel, you opened a video on hexeditor

2013-12-28 22:04:44	Amadiro	if you want to learn about video container formats, read the spec

2013-12-28 22:05:20	RRR2	I wonder if netbeans support javascript
2013-12-28 22:05:36	Amadiro	Nickel, ffmpeg (and it's library-form libav) are general video transcoding tools
2013-12-28 22:05:50	Amadiro	you can *probably* get one of them to parse the header and tell you the info you're looking for
2013-12-28 22:06:03	Nickel	Oh are they like libraries?
2013-12-28 22:06:09	Amadiro	ffmpeg is a program
2013-12-28 22:06:16	Amadiro	libav is the library ffmpeg uses to do all the work
2013-12-28 22:06:35	Amadiro	http://libav.org/
2013-12-28 22:06:38	Nickel	Ah, :S. I need to do this programmatically though.
2013-12-28 22:06:46	Amadiro	no issue with that.
2013-12-28 22:06:50	RRR2	oh is a task
2013-12-28 22:06:55	RRR2	?
2013-12-28 22:07:10	Amadiro	you can start an ffmpeg subprocess and feed it the stream to stdin, probably
2013-12-28 22:07:15	Amadiro	but using libav is cleaner, programmatically
2013-12-28 22:07:23	Amadiro	but probably more work

2013-12-28 22:10:19	Amadiro	Nickel, there is, but most formats don't mandate that it's always at the same location
2013-12-28 22:10:36	Nickel	Amadiro: Oh, that sucks :(.
2013-12-28 22:10:53	Nickel	But if it's .mp4 it will always be in the same spot?
2013-12-28 22:10:59	Amadiro	so it's location in the binary file may vary depending on array lengths, string lengths, presence or absense of certain subheaders etc in the header previous to the information you're looking for
2013-12-28 22:10:59	Amadiro	no
2013-12-28 22:11:07	Amadiro	I mean

2013-12-28 22:11:18	Nickel	Ah ok, I see what you are saying.
2013-12-28 22:11:19	RRR2	I think not

2013-12-28 22:11:52	Amadiro	RRR2, also, the IDAT chunk contains image data (as the name suggests)

2013-12-28 22:13:08	Amadiro	Nickel, really, video formats and containers are generally preeeetty complex beasts
2013-12-28 22:13:17	Amadiro	if you haven't done something like this before, you may want to start with something a tad simpler

2013-12-28 22:30:49	Merryleer	I see.
2013-12-28 22:31:03	Merryleer	Guess it may be time to get my hands dirty. :-)
2013-12-28 22:31:06	jParkton	Link it, acces it, implement it
2013-12-28 22:31:18	RRR2	Oh
2013-12-28 22:31:27	Amadiro	jParkton, new daft punk song right there
2013-12-28 22:31:29	RRR2	I need to learn how to link DLL's..
2013-12-28 22:31:37	RRR2	or acess it;s functions
2013-12-28 22:31:39	jParkton	LOL @ DLLs
2013-12-28 22:31:44	jParkton	fuck MS
2013-12-28 22:31:48	RRR2	Yeah
2013-12-28 22:31:55	RRR2	IT sucks
2013-12-28 22:32:02	RRR2	but I still need to learn that
2013-12-28 22:32:04	jParkton	freelance is doing fine
2013-12-28 22:32:08	Amadiro	RRR2, there are several ways to do it, depending on whether you want to just load them, or load and inspect them dynamically
2013-12-28 22:32:23	jParkton	no more ignorant bosses, no more wasting money on useless stuff
2013-12-28 22:32:24	Amadiro	if you just want to load them, you don't really need to do anything whatsoever
2013-12-28 22:32:26	RRR2	well, I wanted to load them dynamically
2013-12-28 22:32:26	jParkton	tis awesome
2013-12-28 22:32:30	Amadiro	the loader resolves everything automatically for you
2013-12-28 22:32:56	Amadiro	if you want to actually inspect them and check out what kind of functions are inside it, and get function pointers, you use dynload on linux and LoadLibrary[Ex]() on windows
2013-12-28 22:33:49	jParkton	why so complex?
2013-12-28 22:33:58	jParkton	Why not just google the library and read
2013-12-28 22:34:44	Amadiro	well, there are some reasons to dynamically inspect the library and check what's inside it
2013-12-28 22:34:48	Amadiro	but usually you don't need that, no
2013-12-28 22:35:48	RRR2	also, I never understood some of the precompiler code
2013-12-28 22:35:58	RRR2	how is that called

2013-12-28 22:54:21	Merryleer	RRR2: It's much higher-level than ASM, and for the very basic stuff, you don't even get to deal with C's low-level features.
2013-12-28 22:54:30	Left_Turn	the macros and stuff

2013-12-28 22:56:25	Left_Turn	#define name (a bunch of code that happens once you have name somewhere)
2013-12-28 22:56:38	Left_Turn	yep:)

2013-12-28 22:57:22	RRR2	yeah
2013-12-28 22:57:23	Merryleer	Erm, aren't preprocessor directives started with #define? -_-
2013-12-28 22:57:30	Merryleer	Or what preprocessor stuff do you mean?
2013-12-28 22:57:38	Left_Turn	those arent macros.. linking are they?
2013-12-28 22:57:44	Merryleer	You mean include ?
2013-12-28 22:57:46	RRR2	Define is a preprocessor directive

2013-12-28 23:06:53	Merryleer	As a challenge, I guess.
2013-12-28 23:06:54	Merryleer	raylu: I see.
2013-12-28 23:06:57	raylu	just pick one, exactly one, and do it

2013-12-28 23:10:10	Merryleer	jesyspa: Why, because of its more OOP approach?
2013-12-28 23:10:14	jesyspa	Merryleer: And learning both C and C++ as a "challenge" makes rather little sense; you'd be better off learning more varied languages.
2013-12-28 23:10:16	Merryleer	Or why would you say, precisely.
2013-12-28 23:10:24	Merryleer	I see.
2013-12-28 23:10:25	jesyspa	No, because it's too big and interconnected.
2013-12-28 23:10:29	Merryleer	Aha/
2013-12-28 23:10:49	Kelet	Merryleer: C++ is not just C with OOP anymore. It is decades of features stacked ontop of eachother.
2013-12-28 23:10:49	RRR2	if you want a challenge learn malboge
2013-12-28 23:11:11	harso	Rofl
2013-12-28 23:11:14	Kelet	Whereas C was much more conservative with feature adding over the years
2013-12-28 23:11:21	harso	That's more memorisation RRR2
2013-12-28 23:11:41	Kelet	Plus people are less accepting of new revisions of the C language anyway
2013-12-28 23:11:55	Kelet	So most people still programming dialects of C89, whereas C++11 is pretty mainstream.
2013-12-28 23:12:06	Kelet	Makes me sad :(

2013-12-28 23:15:04	Merryleer	harso: Indeed.
2013-12-28 23:15:13	harso	Python is more for scientists and mathematicians
2013-12-28 23:15:18	harso	So personally I'd say it's more suited

2013-12-28 23:20:24	Left_Turn	nice thanks jesyspa
2013-12-28 23:20:29	raylu	tangentstorm: yes
2013-12-28 23:21:24	tangentstorm	raylu: no i just wish that editors supported tree structures and tables using the ascii markup characters that have been around since 1960 or whatever
2013-12-28 23:21:33	raylu	which characters are those?
2013-12-28 23:22:01	tangentstorm	^A ^B ^C  for trees (aka chr(1),chr(2),chr(3))
2013-12-28 23:22:40	tangentstorm	the file/group/row/unit separators are just before the space ... so #28-31 or so

2013-12-28 23:25:24	RRR2	ohh
2013-12-28 23:25:30	RRR2	so you want a tree in ascii
2013-12-28 23:25:34	RRR2	right?
2013-12-28 23:25:39	RRR2	That is awesome
2013-12-28 23:25:45	raylu	yeah, but the only way it could draw it is by introducing characters already used for other things
2013-12-28 23:25:55	raylu	such as linefeeds. and spaces. and lines
2013-12-28 23:25:56	tangentstorm	it would be just like lisp s-expressions or xml but you wouldn't have to escape the markup because it would be pre-escaped
2013-12-28 23:26:27	tangentstorm	a linefeed isn't a visual character
2013-12-28 23:26:28	raylu	tabs and linefeeds are whitespace; your editor doesn't draw them so much as reposition everything else
2013-12-28 23:26:37	tangentstorm	yeah so it could do the same for tables
2013-12-28 23:26:43	raylu	yeah, but it would need some linefeeds to separate the header from the text, probably
2013-12-28 23:26:43	tangentstorm	put the things in colums
2013-12-28 23:26:52	RRR2	you want an ASCII table?
2013-12-28 23:26:52	tangentstorm	or it could make them bold or whatever.
2013-12-28 23:27:18	raylu	no, because then it wouldn't be clear whether the columns were a result of normal whitespace or your record separator
2013-12-28 23:27:23	RRR2	|  try  | try |      #--------------------------------------------#

2013-12-29 10:22:58	jesyspa	darkf: Not quite.  All names that contain two consecutive underscores, or start with an underscore followed by a capital letter, or start with an underscore and are in the global namespace, are reserved.
2013-12-29 10:23:04	jesyspa	(Not entirely sure about that last one.)
2013-12-29 10:23:23	darkf	ahh
2013-12-29 10:23:28	darkf	yeah, that makes sense
2013-12-29 10:23:33	jesyspa	That's why when you see stdlib code all the identifiers are called things like _Base; they can be sure users won't define a macro called that and break everything.
2013-12-29 10:23:45	darkf	:)
2013-12-29 10:23:51	darkf	#define is so bad :)
2013-12-29 10:24:00	jesyspa	You could've used #pragma once.
2013-12-29 10:24:57	darkf	I still don't use it because it never worked on non-MSVC compilers when I used it like 4-5 years ago.
2013-12-29 10:25:07	darkf	but that would probably be useful too.
2013-12-29 10:25:20	jesyspa	Huh, strange, it's worked on GCC for as long as I can remember.
2013-12-29 10:25:30	jesyspa	I'm not sure it works the same way, but I doubt you'll run into those cases.
2013-12-29 10:25:48	darkf	it's possible I was still using gcc 3.5 last I tried it
2013-12-29 10:26:07	 *	jesyspa is on 4.9.
2013-12-29 10:26:08	darkf	but since I like C++11 anyway I may as well use it
2013-12-29 10:26:13	jesyspa	Oh, sorry about the polymorphic lambda, I guess.
2013-12-29 10:26:19	 *	darkf has two installs of mingw (4.6, 4.7)
2013-12-29 10:26:28	jesyspa	Yeah, those won't cut it.
2013-12-29 10:27:08	darkf	heh I left out that all_if lambda anyway for clarity (the only reason I have the is_base_of_all stuff is because it's useful and I have no idea how it works yet, I should read it)
2013-12-29 10:27:26	jesyspa	It's actually very simple recursion.
2013-12-29 10:27:34	jesyspa	If the list is empty, we're done, and return true.
2013-12-29 10:27:55	darkf	let me guess: boost makes that nicer?
2013-12-29 10:27:58	jesyspa	Otherwise, we check if the head satisfies with is_base_of, and whether the tail satisfies with is_base_of_all, and and them together.
2013-12-29 10:28:06	jesyspa	boost has stuff that makes it nicer, but I've never worked with it.
2013-12-29 10:28:14	darkf	ahh
2013-12-29 10:28:26	jesyspa	It probably has some kind of foldr for this.
2013-12-29 10:28:54	darkf	I'm sure with everything it has it has an `all`
2013-12-29 10:29:05	jesyspa	Probably, and a map.
2013-12-29 10:29:16	darkf	awesome.
2013-12-29 10:29:34	jesyspa	Oh, and psht, all_of is much clearer than a hand-written loop.
2013-12-29 10:29:42	jesyspa	(Though the fact you can't easily use a range does make it suck.)
2013-12-29 10:29:42	darkf	:)
2013-12-29 10:29:46	jesyspa	((But boost has something for that!))
2013-12-29 10:30:03	darkf	but boost is a huge dep and this just requires STL, which everyone with a conforming compiler has!
2013-12-29 10:30:27	jesyspa	Except that it isn't?  Everything we're discussing is *still* header-only.
2013-12-29 10:31:00	darkf	hrm. well, maybe providing the relevant headers would be easy
2013-12-29 10:31:01	jesyspa	Meaning you coud just dump the relevant headers in your repo (boost has a tool for that!) and include those.

2013-12-29 10:33:33	darkf	oh, and instead of is_base_of_all couldn't I use template<Component... Components> or something?
2013-12-29 10:33:54	jesyspa	Not valid syntax.
2013-12-29 10:33:59	darkf	dammit.
2013-12-29 10:34:03	darkf	why not :(
2013-12-29 10:34:14	jesyspa	By the way, if you didn't want the dynamic allocation, you could use a boost::any instead of a Component*.

2013-12-29 10:36:24	jesyspa	You make your map go from std::type_info const* to boost::any
2013-12-29 10:36:48	darkf	ah
2013-12-29 10:36:53	jesyspa	And then your users can just pass in their T and you copy or move it into the map.
2013-12-29 10:36:55	darkf	that's cool
2013-12-29 10:37:28	jesyspa	Or you could use the boosts concepts library for this, if you have more functions all components must support.

2013-12-29 11:11:15	jesyspa	Or some copy being made deeper in the guts of the map.

2013-12-29 11:12:03	darkf	it would be nice if LLVM would ship official clang binaries that use MinGW
2013-12-29 11:12:58	darkf	their nightlies use MSVC and I do not have nor want it, and I am sure they are even shittier at C++11 support
2013-12-29 11:13:15	jesyspa	http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map/insert -- I guess const value_type& is picked up instead of P&&.
2013-12-29 11:13:48	jesyspa	I think this is a case where you're meant to use emplace.

2014-01-18 12:54:04	adam789654123	well, im looking through a book: Higher Algebra by Henry Sinclair Hall and Samuel Ratcliff Knight. And the demonstration 12 has inspired me to write a program that can do some basic symbol manipulations
2014-01-18 12:54:43	adam789654123	so basically, in algebra you have products, terms, and fractions
2014-01-18 12:55:12	adam789654123	and they combine in certain ways, like products can be simplified in certain ways
2014-01-18 12:55:21	adam789654123	and like terms can be combined

2014-01-18 12:56:34	adam789654123	for example, replace every instance of `x' with `ak^3'
2014-01-18 12:57:33	adam789654123	where `x^3' becomes `(a^3)(k^9)

2014-01-21 20:49:45	Brq	So why are virtual functions called... well virtual? I mean, I know what they are good for, the word itself just makes little sense to me
2014-01-21 20:50:48	 *	tangentstorm has no idea why they chose that word.
2014-01-21 20:52:52	DevilFish	Brq, because the functions aren't static. They can move around and change places and might not even exist.
2014-01-21 20:53:09	Amadiro	time to have a look at m4...
2014-01-21 20:54:38	tangentstorm	but why 'virtual' instead of 'dynamic' or some other word?
2014-01-21 20:54:58	DevilFish	Probably because it's the same kind of abstraction as virtual memory: It's an illusion
2014-01-21 20:55:01	DevilFish	"virtual"
2014-01-21 20:55:04	tangentstorm	http://www.thefreedictionary.com/virtual has some commentary about usage regarding computers
2014-01-21 20:55:41	DevilFish	"Virtual tends to be used in reference to things that mimic their "real" equivalents."
2014-01-21 20:55:52	adam789654123	i actually think virtual is about a slippery a word as youll find in computing
2014-01-21 20:56:28	adam789654123	as slippery*
2014-01-21 20:57:52	Tangerine	whats the difference between an "unsigned int"
2014-01-21 20:57:58	Tangerine	and an "int" in C++
2014-01-21 20:58:06	adam789654123	the interpretation of the data
2014-01-21 20:58:11	adam789654123	in c anyway
2014-01-21 20:58:29	Brq	Aha, that does make a bit of sense Devilfish
2014-01-21 20:58:54	Tangerine	if they're all positive, is it ok to just use them interchangably?
2014-01-21 20:58:58	Tangerine	or do I need to typecast
2014-01-21 20:59:19	adam789654123	you should be able to use them interchangably
2014-01-21 20:59:25	adam789654123	but they will not work the same
2014-01-21 20:59:41	adam789654123	the cast should be valid, but the result may be unexpected
2014-01-21 20:59:59	tangentstorm	Tangerine: for signed numbers, one of the bits is used to indicate positive/negative.
2014-01-21 21:00:42	Tangerine	for example if I have a function that's supposed to return an int (always positive), and but I return something that I had declared "unsigned int"
2014-01-21 21:00:51	Tangerine	what would happen?
2014-01-21 21:01:04	adam789654123	for example the bits 0001 1111 as signed could mean 1 and -1
2014-01-21 21:01:41	adam789654123	the reason its done this way is because adding one to 1111 rotates the bits to 0000
2014-01-21 21:01:49	adam789654123	such as -1 + 1 = 0
2014-01-21 21:03:17	adam789654123	the leading bit is a way to distinguish between negative and positive
2014-01-21 21:03:54	adam789654123	but unsigned the bits simply represent the binary value
2014-01-21 21:04:46	adam789654123	1111 is 2^4 - 1 = 15 unsigned vs. -1 as signed
2014-01-21 21:04:59	adam789654123	Tangerine: make sense?
2014-01-21 21:05:12	Tangerine	yeah, that makes sense
2014-01-21 21:05:22	adam789654123	Tangerine: great :D
2014-01-21 21:05:28	Tangerine	I understand how they work in the computer, I'm just not sure how it works in C++
2014-01-21 21:05:40	Tangerine	if its positive, it shouldn't be a problem
2014-01-21 21:05:56	Tangerine	EXCEPT in the case where its a very large unsigned number
2014-01-21 21:06:32	adam789654123	I actually am not sure of the implementation specifics, but that c is designed to work with the computer registers and such
2014-01-21 21:06:54	adam789654123	and thats how you would do an efficient implementation via the hardware
2014-01-21 21:09:43	adam789654123	The overflow seems like its basically always a potential problem with the int, short, double, etc.

2014-01-21 22:15:15	ElectricSheep	is the vector also pre-created?
2014-01-21 22:15:29	Tangerine	yes
2014-01-21 22:15:39	raylu	what is the type of the vector?
2014-01-21 22:15:45	adam789654123	where the parameters [x,y,z] might have the arguments [1,2,3], where order does matter.
2014-01-21 22:15:59	raylu	adam789654123: why are you bringing this up?
2014-01-21 22:16:16	adam789654123	because tuples are the subject

2014-01-21 22:16:33	adam789654123	wanted to establish the core idea
2014-01-21 22:16:54	Tangerine	void DoGiftWrap(vector<Tuple*> points, ConvexHullApp *app)
2014-01-21 22:16:57	ElectricSheep	A tuple is just a container for N hetergenous objects.
2014-01-21 22:17:24	Tangerine	don't need to worry about ConvexHullApp, because its just a pointer to another program that does all the fancy stuff
2014-01-21 22:17:48	Tangerine	I'm just trying to implement a Convex Hull Algorithm
2014-01-21 22:18:07	raylu	can we see the rest of the code?
2014-01-21 22:18:20	raylu	because this isn't a c++ std::tuple
2014-01-21 22:18:29	Tangerine	it isnt?
2014-01-21 22:18:37	raylu	right. that class is called "tuple", not Tuple
2014-01-21 22:18:40	raylu	and it's a templated type
2014-01-21 22:18:46	-->	funkykong has joined #learnprogramming
2014-01-21 22:19:17	Tangerine	from the header file we're given
2014-01-21 22:19:33	Tangerine	they're including cstdlib, stdlib, iostream, structs

2014-01-21 22:20:23	ElectricSheep	Also I don't think <Tuple*> even makes sense for a std::tuple.

2014-01-21 22:20:51	Tangerine	what do you mean by "rest of the code"
2014-01-21 22:20:55	carefish	well, then i now have an interesting question regarding tuples
2014-01-21 22:21:03	Tangerine	as in that extra program?
2014-01-21 22:21:03	ElectricSheep	Tuple has to be defined somewhere.
2014-01-21 22:21:07	ElectricSheep	I imagine in one of those headers.
2014-01-21 22:21:12	carefish	i started this sample, but i can't get 'type based access' to work
2014-01-21 22:21:37	carefish	http://ideone.com/Fx4Bqt
2014-01-21 22:21:42	raylu	the code that calls DoGiftWrap
2014-01-21 22:21:53	-->	funkykong has joined #learnprogramming
2014-01-21 22:22:24	ElectricSheep	You have get<0>(tupleVector[i])
2014-01-21 22:22:32	ElectricSheep	and then get<int>(*(tupleVector[i]))
2014-01-21 22:22:44	carefish	it's the second forloop i'm not getting to work
2014-01-21 22:22:46	carefish	first one works
2014-01-21 22:22:52	ElectricSheep	Well yes.
2014-01-21 22:22:56	ElectricSheep	tupleVector is vector<tuple<int, string, double>>
2014-01-21 22:23:00	ElectricSheep	not vector<tuple<int, string, double>*>

2014-01-21 22:23:42	Tangerine	so, there is a using namespace std that's pretty standard
2014-01-21 22:23:52	Tangerine	do they just assume Tuple = tuple?
2014-01-21 22:24:48	raylu	there's no way to "assume" that
2014-01-21 22:25:34	raylu	carefish: it's not a const char *, it's a string
2014-01-21 22:25:51	Tangerine	is tuple defined in SDL or SDL_gfxPrimitives?
2014-01-21 22:25:52	carefish	oh damn
2014-01-21 22:25:53	ElectricSheep	^ this
2014-01-21 22:26:01	carefish	so i should call .c_str() on it
2014-01-21 22:26:06	raylu	Tangerine: i could tell you if you showed me the rest of the code :D
2014-01-21 22:26:11	carefish	or just use string
2014-01-21 22:26:15	raylu	carefish: you shouldn't have to call .c_str()
2014-01-21 22:26:16	ElectricSheep	Do you see this part of the error output: template<unsigned int _Int, class _Tp1, class _Tp2>
2014-01-21 22:26:18	carefish	eitherone should work
2014-01-21 22:26:21	ElectricSheep	In the possible candidates?
2014-01-21 22:26:24	carefish	hehe, gotcha raylu
2014-01-21 22:26:28	ElectricSheep	string is a class.
2014-01-21 22:26:32	ElectricSheep	const char* is not.
2014-01-21 22:27:07	carefish	well, even when using string it dies
2014-01-21 22:33:22	raylu	how does it die?
2014-01-21 22:33:51	carefish	a scary template error
2014-01-21 22:34:01	carefish	i still find those hard to read/understand
2014-01-21 22:34:03	raylu	can we see the code and error?
2014-01-21 22:34:12	raylu	they are. you just gotta slog through it

2014-01-21 22:39:55	ElectricSheep	But I'm using clang (llvm 3.4svn)

2014-01-21 22:53:00	raylu	no. i was just thinking of a feature that actually doesn't apply to c++ classes
2014-01-21 22:53:06	carefish	(if i recall correctly)
2014-01-21 22:53:06	Brq	Does it matter with pointers? I was a bit confused

2014-01-21 22:53:30	Ayey_	That sounds helpful..
2014-01-21 22:53:34	Brq	if the first just lets you read, does that mean 'c' becomes a copy of a pointer or somethign?

2014-01-21 22:54:28	raylu	in the second, i think 'c' is a reference to the pointer, which is pointless and equivalent (maybe)
2014-01-21 22:54:48	Brq	well that was my original thought, but one time, I had an issue where when I didnt use a reference, I would get an access violation
2014-01-21 22:54:53	Brq	always, at the smae place
2014-01-21 22:54:57	Brq	and never when I used a reference
2014-01-21 22:55:02	Brq	however it never made ANY sense to me
2014-01-21 22:55:24	carefish	it's a c++11 feature

2014-01-22 20:38:39	raylu	it probably makes more sense to start by picking some OSS that you use rather than randomly searching through issues
2014-01-22 20:39:06	raylu	alternatively, you can try implementing https://github.com/LearnProgramming/learntris/ and maybe help finish the tests
2014-01-22 20:39:21	gh00z	hmm, i suppose. they all seem to be a bit more complicated than I am expecting

2014-01-23 22:09:45	tangentstorm	can anyone explain to me how the LANG environment variable works, and where to look in the code to understand it?
2014-01-23 22:09:49	tangentstorm	and/or :)
2014-01-23 22:10:29	tangentstorm	without LANG=UTF-8 , tmux shows box drawing characters as lettters. With LANG=UTF-8, python-3 won't start. :/
2014-01-23 22:10:34	ElectricSheep	LANG   Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifically selected with a variable starting with LC_.
2014-01-23 22:10:38	ElectricSheep	from bash man page
2014-01-23 22:10:51	tangentstorm	yeah but it's not part of bash... it affects everything.
2014-01-23 22:11:13	Amadiro	$ LANG=UTF-8 python
2014-01-23 22:11:13	Amadiro	Python 2.7.2 (default, Jul 15 2011, 14:40:47)
2014-01-23 22:11:13	Amadiro	>>>
2014-01-23 22:11:30	tangentstorm	yeah python 2 works fine, Amadiro ... it's python 3 that fails for me
2014-01-23 22:11:31	Amadiro	works with python 3 as well
2014-01-23 22:11:35	tangentstorm	oh?
2014-01-23 22:11:37	tangentstorm	hrm
2014-01-23 22:11:48	tangentstorm	perhaps the issue is specific to freebsd...
2014-01-23 22:11:56	Amadiro	tried on both RHEL6 and archlinux
2014-01-23 22:12:13	Amadiro	I don't know if UTF-8 is even a valid value for LANG, though
2014-01-23 22:12:16	tangentstorm	Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
2014-01-23 22:12:17	tangentstorm	ValueError: CODESET is not set or empty
2014-01-23 22:12:33	Amadiro	tangentstorm, it may be that in my shell some LC_ variable is set, which python prefers to read
2014-01-23 22:12:37	Amadiro	but in your shell, it is not set
2014-01-23 22:12:42	Amadiro	so it falls back to reading $LANG
2014-01-23 22:12:44	<--	JordanG has quit (Quit: ZNC - http://znc.in)
2014-01-23 22:12:48	tangentstorm	i don't know, either. it's all magic to me, which is why i'm trying to understand it. :)
2014-01-23 22:13:21	Amadiro	I also have LC_COLLATE="C" and LC_TIME="de_DE.UTF-8"
2014-01-23 22:13:27	Amadiro	are those set for you?
2014-01-23 22:13:51	tangentstorm	nope
2014-01-23 22:14:05	ElectricSheep	you might check the man page for setlocale(3)
2014-01-23 22:14:28	Amadiro	tangentstorm, try setting LANG to "en_US.UTF-8" and see if that works for both python and tmux
2014-01-23 22:14:43	ElectricSheep	should at least point you to where all of the available locale codes are.
2014-01-23 22:15:01	tangentstorm	Amadiro: it does! thank you! :)
2014-01-23 22:15:16	Amadiro	np -- I guess "UTF-8" wasn't a valid value, then
2014-01-23 22:15:17	tangentstorm	and thanks for the man page, ElectricSheep
2014-01-23 22:15:22	ElectricSheep	I'm going to say that LANG is the default locale for all environ variables specified by setlocale() that you haven't specifically set.
2014-01-23 22:15:31	Amadiro	and tmux accepted it leniently
2014-01-23 22:16:06	tangentstorm	yeah, from what i could tell it was kind of a hack they put in to cope with some nonstandard behavior in putty
2014-01-23 22:16:27	Amadiro	"A  locale  name  is  typically of the form language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier], where language is an ISO 639 language code, territory is an ISO 3166 country code, and codeset is a character set or encoding  identifier  like ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8."
2014-01-23 22:17:00	ElectricSheep	for me, all of my locales are in /usr/share/locale/

2014-01-23 22:28:10	tangentstorm	cnc android programming?
2014-01-23 22:29:16	@intothev01d	yea i worked on hooking up the Arduino to an Android device yesterday to see if I could get it to make the serial connection over usb. seems to work so far. now i have to start working on an assignment for class with Android as well
2014-01-23 22:32:36	tangentstorm	fun
2014-01-23 22:33:50	@intothev01d	yes so far

2014-01-23 22:37:33	tangentstorm	i have a breadboard hooked up to my laptop here, with 5 LEDs counting in binary. that was my first circuit.
2014-01-23 22:37:50	tangentstorm	i'm planning to work through another one or two exercises this weekend.
2014-01-23 22:37:55	tangentstorm	kind of have my hands full at the moment though.
