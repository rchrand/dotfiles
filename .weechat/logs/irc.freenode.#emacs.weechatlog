2013-11-11 22:05:00	JordiGH	didi: It's kinda bad that there have been over 150 git push --force. It means you need to recover the missing refs from 150 reflogs now. Looks like not all Jenkins developers have all of the repos, and Github itself is being slow about providing the necessary data, so it's up to each individual who might have the relevant hashes to restore the data.

2013-11-11 22:38:33	JordiGH	ruediger: They're sponsoring this weekend's hg code sprint in NYC.
2013-11-11 22:38:44	JordiGH	I would go, but y'know, USA border crossing.

2013-11-11 22:43:45	nicferrier	I think for these big companies exotic VC makes some sense.
2013-11-11 22:43:58	nicferrier	like google uses perforce. it makes some sense.
2013-11-11 22:44:04	nicferrier	must be frustrating though.

2013-11-11 22:44:59	marcanuy	how can I find out the values of an variable in a list? e.g. substatement-open in c-offsets-alist

2013-11-11 22:47:20	JordiGH	Not by itself, anyways.
2013-11-11 22:47:37	JordiGH	It's in the actual log (and across all branches), but you'd have to write a bit of a script to extract the information from it.
2013-11-11 22:47:50	JordiGH	revsets *are* "a bit of a script", they are their own DSL, but they're built-in to hg.

2013-11-12 21:54:41	JordiGH	Actually, even if I opt out of Facebook, a lot of people I know are populating their database with my information anyways. You can't really escape it unless you become more of an actual hermit IRL.

2013-11-12 22:10:24	tali713	SamB: well, the way they used to do things was to keep data super secure as well, that is, by the NSAs view the question doesn't start with "how do you stop a mole"  it start's with "assume you have at least one mole".  so the way it should work is that unless there was an absurd unidirectional shift in the culture of the NSA, a few bad apples shouldn't matter.
2013-11-12 22:11:01	tali713	SamB: however legislated interagency transperancy rules make it very difficult to do this properly.
2013-11-12 22:11:02	wgreenhouse	tali713: the problem seems to be that the stuff that Snowden walked off with wasn't even considered sensitive.

2013-11-12 22:21:27	wgreenhouse	JordiGH: in that case, the question of whether or not it's ethical for a hacker to work for Facebook is a bit irrelevant, since the vast majority of SaaS companies that handle personally identifiable user data would simply have to close, under that ethical imperative.
2013-11-12 22:21:29	wgreenhouse	there would be no Facebooks to work for.

2013-11-12 22:24:02	JordiGH	And "inasmuch as possible" is kinda wishy-washy, I know. Perhaps just shut itself down if it can't ensure that it can guarantee user's safety.

2013-11-15 21:27:54	Sebboh	Recently I learned to use M-x erc-tls instead of M-x erc.  However, my fingers seem to hit enter early too often, particularly when Hodapp has been passing around the rum.  How can I 'alias' erc --> erc-tls without breaking things?

2013-11-15 21:47:33	BruceConnor	Hi everyone
2013-11-15 21:47:36	BruceConnor	quick question
2013-11-15 21:47:40	BruceConnor	Given a buffer (or buffer-name), is there a function to check if that buffer is currently visible? (if it's being shown in any window or not?)
2013-11-15 21:47:45	SamB	I mean a real public library would let you see ALL of ALL of the books that you can find on public shelves
2013-11-15 21:48:07	SamB	not arbitrarily excise excercizes or whatnot
2013-11-15 21:48:09	wgreenhouse	BruceConnor: yes.  ,,df get-buffer-window
2013-11-15 21:48:09	fsbot	get-buffer-window is a built-in function in `window.c'.
2013-11-15 21:48:09	fsbot	(get-buffer-window &optional BUFFER-OR-NAME ALL-FRAMES)
2013-11-15 21:48:09	fsbot	Return a window currently displaying BUFFER-OR-NAME, or nil if none. ..[Type ,more]

2013-11-15 22:29:02	ruediger	security issues in ffmpeg (libav) are not uncommon
2013-11-15 22:29:29	zacts	isn't there a new alternative to ffmpeg?
2013-11-15 22:29:38	Sebboh	The spirit of the law was to have that text in that software forever.  Debian has taken the pointy head lawyer point of view and asserted that the legalese is counter-mission (note the difference between the legalese and the text!).  So, I'm in favor of patching the legalese and ending this emacs-nonfree crap.  I can't imagine that anyone would take that text OUT.  And I personally volunteer to pester any fork that takes it out to put
2013-11-15 22:29:38	Sebboh	it back in.  ..But I trust Debian's legal folk if they say that the leagalse re: invariant blah blah needs to go.
2013-11-15 22:30:05	JordiGH	zacts: Yes, libav is a fork of ffmpeg.

2013-11-15 22:31:06	JordiGH	ruediger: I spoke with the libav guys at GSoC, and the ffmpeg dudes seem to me a lot more evil than libav.
2013-11-15 22:31:19	JordiGH	It's a hostile fork, but I wouldn't say it's an evil one.
2013-11-15 22:32:21	SamB	Sebboh: well, if RMS wants legalese to keep people from changing it, then Debian isn't going to want it in main.  On the other hand if RMS wants to host it on his website to keep people from changing it, Debian won't mind a bit.
2013-11-15 22:33:12	technomancy	wgreenhouse: given the tussle over the mozilla trademarks it seems unlikely
2013-11-15 22:33:15	SamB	if RMS would content himself with asking nicely, Debian would be happy to comply with his request
2013-11-15 22:33:54	Sebboh	I am not familar with the details of this libav security problem, but, since media streams are huge binary blobs, I just assume that they are evil executables and run them on my fiancee's laptop instead of mine.  Also she has a better screen.
2013-11-15 22:34:01	SamB	JordiGH: so it's a fork that is hostile to an "evil" group of people?
2013-11-15 22:34:23	JordiGH	SamB: Yeah, the ffmpeg lead dev is a real prick.
2013-11-15 22:34:31	JordiGH	According to what I heard from the libav guys, anyways.
2013-11-15 22:34:42	ruediger	JordiGH: the issue is certainly a bit complicated
2013-11-15 22:34:48	SamB	Sebboh: that doesn't sound very considerate ;-P
2013-11-15 22:35:04	wgreenhouse	technomancy: that at least was settled quasi-amicably, with moz people actually devoting their time to maintaining the dfsg-free fork

2013-11-20 22:14:18	wgreenhouse	Zephy: meh, that's taste, and depends on what kind of documents you work with.  I still use two spaces when ending a sentence when I write English.
2013-11-20 22:14:25	Zephy	seriously?
2013-11-20 22:14:25	fsbot	I know. Right?
2013-11-20 22:14:26	technomancy	Zephy: I've considered it, but I don't think there's a clear answer.
2013-11-20 22:14:30	rryoumaa	i use 2 spaces always with ascii
2013-11-20 22:14:43	Zephy	Never seen any two space documents.
2013-11-20 22:14:49	technomancy	personally I use one space out of habit, but two spaces makes more sense in a monospace face.
2013-11-20 22:14:55	turbofail	i always use two spaces
2013-11-20 22:14:56	Zephy	But I suppose if its "common" practice
2013-11-20 22:14:56	rryoumaa	i output to 1 space when the format in principle supports it such as with proportional fonts and stuff
2013-11-20 22:15:13	rryoumaa	common indeed
2013-11-20 22:15:24	Zephy	I mean there really is no use for using two spaces over one.
2013-11-20 22:15:34	rryoumaa	Zephy: if there were no use for it nobody would do it
2013-11-20 22:15:40	rryoumaa	it sets off sentences
2013-11-20 22:15:45	Zephy	Sure M-a/e might take you to a etc. dot, but ... :/
2013-11-20 22:15:46	turbofail	well for me it's just habit
2013-11-20 22:15:51	aidalgol	Oh, gnu, NOT THIS AGAIN!!
2013-11-20 22:16:05	turbofail	i don't particularly see any advantage to it, it's just what i automatically do
2013-11-20 22:16:06	wgreenhouse	Zephy: the received hacker wisdom on this point is garbled.  The actual practice at publishers is to use a wider space (not nearly as much as two intra-sentence spaces, however) when printing in a proportional font.  In monospace/typewriting, you're supposed to use two spaces, according to the old publishing conventions.

2013-11-20 22:16:27	Zephy	Hmm
2013-11-20 22:16:42	technomancy	Zephy: in any case the fact that we're having this conversation is proof that it's not uncontroversial enough to qualify for better-defaults =)
2013-11-20 22:16:54	Zephy	Jorgi 1/3 = 0.333.. => *3 and you got your proof ^^
2013-11-20 22:16:54	aidalgol	wgreenhouse: That the the period is closer to the last letter.
2013-11-20 22:17:02	aidalgol	So there's two parts to the kerning.
2013-11-20 22:17:07	Zephy	I agree technomancy.

2013-11-20 22:17:52	Zephy	Nope its the result of manual division JordiGH
2013-11-20 22:17:54	tromey	I use double-space, but only because that is what my 7th grade typing teacher drilled into my head
2013-11-20 22:17:56	JordiGH	So if you multiply by 3 both sides of an approximation, you still only get an approximation.
2013-11-20 22:18:01	wgreenhouse	aidalgol: (as rear guards of double-space on computers)
2013-11-20 22:18:05	tromey	then later enforced by the GNU standards, which one must not question
2013-11-20 22:18:14	bremner	I triple-space, just in case.
2013-11-20 22:18:18	JordiGH	Zephy: The result of a manual division? That doesn't make sense, how are you getting the result of an infinite process? The division never ends!
2013-11-20 22:18:32	Zephy	JordiGH you can obviously see that it loops

2013-11-20 22:19:41	Zephy	No
2013-11-20 22:19:43	rryoumaa	ruediger: good point.  in about 2h20m, double space has been used about 36 times in this channel alone.
2013-11-20 22:19:44	waisl	JordiGH: I had an extended debate with another mathematician about 0.999... = 1, weird thing was that he was willing to accept that .333... = 1/3 but not 0.999... = 1, proofs did not sway him

2013-11-24 15:26:40	bitonic	this is very frustrating

2013-11-24 15:26:44	bitonic	yes
2013-11-24 15:26:58	bitonic	I think there is something set about the mode-line height
2013-11-24 15:27:17	echo-area	Hmm.  What if you do "emacs -Q", and then evaluate the code

2013-11-24 15:28:39	bitonic	?  why?
2013-11-24 15:28:57	bitonic	I'm pretty sure it's emacs.  I can use "8x13" in the rest of the system just fine

2013-11-24 16:57:24	YetiBob	hey, i recently switched back to GNU Emacs after about 20 years of XEmacs.  It's going great for the most part
2013-11-24 16:57:45	dizzylizzy	YetiBob, welcome back
2013-11-24 16:57:58	YetiBob	however there's something that i am doing occasionally by accident, some key sequence or mouse gesture, that causes emacs to ignore all kbd input

2013-11-25 11:45:44	Silex	anyway, I think the problem is that in the US people are taught that it's perfectly fine to have a gun, and that you should have one
2013-11-25 11:45:51	Silex	it sure looks taht way from teh outside
2013-11-25 11:46:01	surrounder	don't think that's a problem either

2013-11-25 11:46:30	Silex	it's only a side step away from banalizing using it
2013-11-25 11:46:49	tvaalen	Here in Sweden it's kind of the same thing. We've dismantled much of our defense to a point where we can't do much at all. And now the politicians have started talking about joining NATO for guarantees, etc.

2013-11-25 13:18:10	TaylanUB	If you want to use that one, then you have to put (load-library "color-theme") or so first in your .emacs, then you can use the functions of that library.

2013-11-27 18:48:50	c107	I thought that Emacs payed attention to keys' scancodes, not their input.  My keyboard is Dvorak, and I can't type Russian because the layout provided by Emacs is jumbled.
2013-11-27 18:49:50	sunmoonstar	I have the regular windows cmd.exe running in a shell-mode buffer and it works great except for when I issue a command that asks for a response (like "Continue? (y/n))... when that happens, emacs does not show me the prompt although I am able to answer it with y. Once I've answered it, it will show me what the prompt was. Anyone have an idea what could be going wrong there?

2013-11-27 19:21:56	necros	any sugestions for a better keyboard binding for other-frame?
2013-11-27 19:21:56	wgreenhouse	microcode: depends on your use case and where your mail comes from.  For me, it made sense to have my system MTA + ~/.procmailrc handle delivery into various sub-Maildirs.  then Gnus just gets them with (setq gnus-select-method '(nnmaildir "" (directory "~/Maildir/")))
2013-11-27 19:21:56	microcode	necros: I use a chord with key-chords.el
2013-11-27 19:22:20	wgreenhouse	microcode: so delivery into the maildirs happens automatically even when *gasp* Emacs isn't running

2013-11-28 13:20:12	crocket	hi
2013-11-28 13:20:24	barabara	 I have middle size class CPP file of ~400 lines of code. There are some new methods not being shown when unfolding my class in the speedbar frame. Looks like speedbar displays the tree from several previous iterations of my code . P.S. Update Command doesn't help. GNU Emacs 24.3.1 (x86_64-suse-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.8.4) . Speedbar installed from the melpa package manager
2013-11-28 13:20:29	crocket	How do I detect an empty input from an interactive function?

2013-11-28 13:24:13	-->	kasterma has joined #emacs
2013-11-28 13:24:13	ggole	Btw, that interactive spec implies that your function will always receive an argument, so you might consider making it non-optional

2013-11-28 13:26:13	YoungFrog	anyway, &optional is usually nice for backward compatibility but otherwise explicit is better IMO
2013-11-28 13:26:25	barabara	kodein: thanks, but that does not help either

2013-11-28 13:39:02	fsbot	I think ide is [0] an acronym for integrated development environment.

2013-11-28 13:42:04	quotemstr	It's not even a store. It's a market for computer hardware full of shady, dusty, hot stores and people who lie and wheel and haggle.
2013-11-28 13:42:22	bremner	ebay??
2013-11-28 13:42:22	fsbot	My sources say no

2013-11-28 13:43:09	quotemstr	There's food for sale, sewage in depressions in the steet, shady well-dressed characters carrying strangely lumpy briefcases
2013-11-28 13:43:26	quotemstr	There are no regular computer stores in Delhi, I think.
2013-11-28 13:43:38	quotemstr	Everything goes through this bazaar.
2013-11-28 13:43:44	barabara	Great :P

2013-11-28 13:49:37	quotemstr	varlog: Oh, they obviously knew who had it and bought it from that person
2013-11-28 13:50:03	quotemstr	The reason is took so long is that they were haggling so as to keep as much of $PRICE for themselves as possible.
2013-11-28 13:50:23	quotemstr	I could probably have haggled them down or gone to other shopkeepers myself.
2013-11-28 13:50:31	quotemstr	But it still ended up being less than Newegg.
2013-11-28 13:50:34	varlog	i see
2013-11-28 13:51:15	kensanata	Grrr. I have a process (a comint process to be specific) which I want to have utf-8 encoding. So I set process-coding-system. Tracking it to comint-exec-1, I see that the process uses utf-8 for encoding and decoding. When I'm in my comint buffer, however, (process-coding-system (get-buffer-process (current-buffer))) says latin-1.

2013-11-28 15:45:42	YoungFrog	beware, with-help-window doesn't select the help buffer but redirects standard-output, so you should use e.g. `princ' and not `insert' (I was bitten by this one)
2013-11-28 15:45:48	kensanata	forcer: Interesting.
2013-11-28 15:46:00	kensanata	YoungFrog: Even more interesting, haha.

2013-12-03 10:51:22	Fuco	but if you talk 200 pages about ideals and then call something I, it's pretty clear what's going on, even if you forget to write it down

2013-12-03 13:04:12	skanev	when I evaluate set-default-font or when I put it in .emacs.d/init.el

2013-12-03 13:06:28	skanev	nope, same
2013-12-03 13:06:39	ScriptDevil	Also, you could set minibuffer-frame-alist to something like ((width . 80) (height . 4))

All I'm seeing: "gnuplot> plot '/tmp/org-plot14744UCi' using 1:2 with lines title 'second column',\ >    '/tmp/org-plot14744UCi' using 1:3 with lines title 'last column'"   How do I see the graphs?

2013-12-03 17:03:02	Fuco	because here it is actually ambiguous
2013-12-03 17:03:11	TaylanUB	"Your maternal parent is so over-weight, ..."
2013-12-03 17:03:14	Fuco	e.g. there are things that you can get "infinitely precise" but not 1
2013-12-03 17:03:25	TaylanUB	Did I just make up the term "maternal parent" though ?
2013-12-03 17:03:33	Fuco	like the amplification algorithms, for example
2013-12-03 17:03:34	bremner	TaylanUB: how is that an improvement?

2013-12-03 17:03:57	ijp	bremner: I guess in the same way gynaecology is a better term than "voyeurism"
2013-12-03 17:04:04	-->	stardiviner has joined #emacs
2013-12-03 17:04:05	ijp	er, medical voyeurism

2013-12-03 17:04:07	-->	stardiviner has joined #emacs
2013-12-03 17:04:23	ijp	sounds more clinical
2013-12-03 17:04:37	bremner	no, ur clinical
2013-12-03 17:05:10	Fuco	I fucking hate ##math... if you talk there at all people will start PMing you with stupid shit
2013-12-03 17:05:17	Fuco	"Hey did you ever study calculus?"
2013-12-03 17:05:55	Fuco	I wonder if I can block PMs from people who are in ##math and not in other channels common with me
2013-12-03 17:05:59	ijp	if you're going to insult someone, you should at least do it on-channel. it's only polite.

2013-12-03 17:07:21	Fuco	it's no point complaining there because these people usually /quit after 15 seconds
2013-12-03 17:07:23	Hodapp	yeah, my ex would always pull shit like th.... nevermind.
2013-12-03 17:07:49	Fuco	I come home after 2 hours and 50 PMs await me, all with questions like that :/
2013-12-03 17:08:10	-->	stardiviner has joined #emacs
2013-12-03 17:08:19	emaphis``	let's go to #emacs to get help with our emacs homework.
2013-12-03 17:08:21	ijp	I'm confused. are these requests for help? or unsubtle digs at your ability?
2013-12-03 17:08:31	ijp	or both?
2013-12-03 17:08:56	ijp	(and yes, it can be both, although it would be very counterproductive)

2013-12-03 17:09:24	Fuco	wrt calculus it could be both :P
2013-12-03 17:10:07	Fuco	but that channel is hopeless most of the time anyway. swarmed with people asking for help on multiplication of complex numbers. Which isn't wrong, but it adds so much noise there's never a useful discussion
2013-12-03 17:10:11	Fuco	so, somewhat like here
2013-12-03 17:10:25	<--	ubolonton has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-03 17:10:27	ijp	yeah, this place would be so much better if people didn't ask emacs questions

2013-12-03 17:10:36	Fuco	ikr!
2013-12-03 17:11:15	emaphis	lets go to #emacs for help on our org-mode homework.

2013-12-03 17:12:25	Fuco	I have logs for the year and bit I've been here, if you write the algorithm I can run it. And then look at it in private.
2013-12-03 17:12:41	baboon`	what are people going to think when they see we talk about "overweight maternal parents"?
2013-12-03 17:13:06	remote	ijp: will it move?
2013-12-03 17:13:07	offby1	your maternel parent's weight exceeded the bounds necessary for the USPS to allocate a zip code

2013-12-03 17:14:04	Fuco	I wonder if I could just throw the log in R or Octave and it would do something useful

2013-12-03 17:15:03	dim	offby1: I mean clearly your excuse for not being able to get to work is solid, yet you could be working from home given the situation, that's probably the best situation to open the talk about remote working, right?
2013-12-03 17:15:08	emaphis	You'd have to clean the wood chipper later.

2013-12-12 16:46:48	Trevoke	But in general, what emaphis` said is about right. Learn to use the emacs help (C-h followed by Key, Variable, Function, Read, Mode, Info, Tutorial, Apropos) and ask open-ended questions. Also sometimes M-x followed by "type what you want" is useful. That's how I learned about emacs' calculator and calendar.

2013-12-12 16:52:49	JoelMcCracken	good advice ^^
2013-12-12 16:54:05	w|t	i've read the wiki and everything about smooth scrolling, but i can never get "responsive" scrolling that would respond to my "strength" of mouse wheel scrolling (it would only lengthen the scroll amount.) i am using cocoa emacs if that helps.
2013-12-12 16:54:11	jeeger	Trevoke: One problem with the "type what you want" approach is that Emacs hase some strange terminology. "auto-fill-mode" isn't what I would be thinking about first.

2013-12-22 14:48:38	sbp	is there a post-theme-load hook for load-theme? looking at the load-theme source I can't find any obvious thing. basically I'd like to be able to put something in my init.el that says when a certain theme is loaded, take some extra actions
2013-12-22 14:49:28	crtxc	I was thinking of trying out bbdb.  Would it be a good idea to get vm?  This is a possible option for use with bbdb, and by vm I am assuming vm-thread, though I don't know what this el packages is for.

2013-12-22 14:50:12	alezost	crtxc: not at all; also you may replace "yes/no" with "y/n" in prompts by adding (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p) to your .emacs

2013-12-22 14:59:30	sbp	yeah, thanks. I did pretty much the same. just wanted to always use a standard font after loading a new theme, though I can imagine wanting to use it for many other purposes too, such as augmenting specific upstream themes etc.

The goal is to reach reasonable compatibility with GNU Emacs during 2013. The longer term goal is to phase out Emacs Lisp in favour for Clojure, to add a Web UI and re-capture Emacs' spirit on a contemporary platform.

It seems there should be some way to escape newlines that is more efficient than base64-encode-string, since that only acts on newlines, the other on the whole string

2013-12-27 22:08:24	Fuco	re stumpwm, I've tried to go through the docs, but half the things there didn't work... I couldn't even compile the info because the sources in git were broken :d
2013-12-27 22:08:30	justin_smith	bpalmer: but it is (infamously even) turing complete
2013-12-27 22:08:44	Fuco	I guess I'll revert back to xmonad until I have time to hack on that
2013-12-27 22:08:44	justin_smith	remember that ruby-gems exploit
2013-12-27 22:08:48	bpalmer	really? perhaps I don't understand yaml very well.
2013-12-27 22:09:04	bpalmer	ToBeReplaced: perhaps you just need to add some calls to yaml-mode-hook ? 
2013-12-27 22:09:06	Fuco	yaml -- the json you can parse with grep

2013-12-28 16:45:30	thevishy	I mean do we have vim like yank a line that speeds up a bit
2013-12-28 16:45:58	thevishy	I can see M+w by default does a copy from the mark to bottom for example which is neat
2013-12-28 16:46:12	axrfnu	off the top off my head i do not know of a builtin way, but it would require only most simple elisp

Older movie, such as 101 Dalmatians, which was released uncut on DVD after Disney banned smoking in its films, portrays Cruella de Vil as a fanatic smoker.

2014-01-18 12:57:14	jlf	wgreenhouse: but seriously given the absence of any sort of power outlets i expect it'd be either something like a solar panel integrated into the case for continuous trickle-charging or a hand-crank/flywheel/generator thing like those emergency radios.  the latter seems more likely for mobile use since it wouldn't depend on the weather.

2014-01-18 13:00:49	jlf	nicferrier: maybe yeah.  integrated solar is more up bh's technical alley but it's less accessible for average users to repair, costlier to design and test, dependent on weather as i mentioned, etc. whereas the flywheel approach could be assembled from ots parts and could be completely decoupled from the laptop
2014-01-18 13:01:20	jlf	of course, the solar approach could be so decoupled too..

I don't think using FDE ever makes you more vulnerable than not using it, but it's not a silver bullet either.

2014-01-21 21:44:54	Fuco	it's the worst wiki in existence
2014-01-21 21:45:06	ldionmarcil	Fuco: the emacs ide page is a fine starting point.
2014-01-21 21:45:08	magneticduck	anxt: there is no doubting it, vim is a fast editor, and the commands are good

2014-01-21 21:45:59	magneticduck	I understand that emacs has its own solutions, but from what I've seen, vim is still a .. faster .. editor, as far as it comes to editing text
2014-01-21 21:46:11	magneticduck	if I'm wrong correct me
2014-01-21 21:46:17	magneticduck	but that's what it appears at first sight

But, well, searching linkedin for lisp jobs currently gives me 8 hits, 42 hits for ruby, 106 for python, and 309 for java.

2014-01-22 22:49:16	maio	I have interactive function which needs compilation buffer so I'm using (interactive "bcompilation buffer: ") - is there some way to make it display/filter only buffers which are using compilation-mode?
2014-01-22 22:50:17	pjb	maio: yes.  Instead of passing a string to interactive, pass a list.
2014-01-22 22:52:59	pjb	Something like: (interactive (list (completing-read "Compilation buffer: " (mapcar (lambda (buffer) (cons (buffer-name buffer) buffer)) (remove-if-not (lambda (buffer) (with-current-buffer buffer (eql major-mode 'compilation-mode))) (buffer-list))) (lambda (info) (cdr info))  t)))

2014-01-22 23:13:59	wgreenhouse	rryoumaa: tor can (and in fact should) be run with minimal permissions.  since the socks port (9050, or 9150 for torbrowser's bundled tor) is a high number and not one of the "well-recognized ports", unprivileged users can set up listeners on it.
2014-01-22 23:14:04	wgreenhouse	the user of for the tor daemon in the normal debian packages is "debian-tor", with a shell of /bin/false and a home dir of /dev/null, iirc
2014-01-22 23:14:21	quotemstr	You know, in Windows, you don't need special permissions to drop permissions.
2014-01-22 23:15:31	SamB	quotemstr: yeah ...
2014-01-22 23:15:45	SamB	try telling twb that
2014-01-22 23:16:03	wgreenhouse	that's a "life in the harebrained world of init" problem
2014-01-22 23:16:10	<--	rpg has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2014-01-22 23:16:16	SamB	oh, and earlier he was trying to strace chromium *as root* and it wouldn't let him
2014-01-22 23:16:37	quotemstr	Hearing twb try to admit that Windows has merit would be like seeing Theo de Raadt try to play a mall santa.

2014-01-22 23:17:22	tmarble	(sorry for the FAQ): what's the deal with elpa being down?
2014-01-22 23:17:46	didi`	tmarble: It's not down for me.
2014-01-22 23:17:49	SamB	quotemstr: I meant, if you want your daemon to run as its own user you damn well better have some way of getting it logged in
2014-01-22 23:17:52	quotemstr	SamB: What I really like about the appcontainer system is that Microsoft is using it as a way to ditch backward compatibility is critical areas.
2014-01-22 23:18:06	quotemstr	SamB: Your favorite init system can run a daemon as any user.

2014-01-22 23:19:05	SamB	so, I guess what I mean is that the traditional unix way of "dropping privileges" would probably have similar issues on Windows
2014-01-22 23:19:53	SamB	I mean, you know, dropping them AFTER initialization has begun
2014-01-22 23:20:22	quotemstr	SamB: Windows permissions are a lot more fine-grained.
2014-01-22 23:20:34	SamB	I know
2014-01-22 23:20:37	SamB	I didn't dispute that
2014-01-22 23:20:38	quotemstr	SamB: Everything is protected by ACLs, not by crude user tests.
2014-01-22 23:20:52	quotemstr	SamB: You don't need to drop permissions if you're only started with exactly what you need in the first place.
2014-01-22 23:20:57	SamB	ACLs or some kind of "privilege" flags
2014-01-22 23:21:06	quotemstr	But even if you do, it's pretty easy to start a new process with permissions that are a strict subset of your own.
2014-01-22 23:21:26	quotemstr	SamB: Well, say I need to grant a service the right to start and stop a particular VM.
2014-01-22 23:21:32	<--	katspaugh has quit (Quit: katspaugh)
2014-01-22 23:21:37	quotemstr	SamB: I just just add that service's SID to the VM's ACL. It just works.
2014-01-22 23:21:38	SamB	quotemstr: don't programs often have some privileges that they don't need throughout?
2014-01-22 23:21:55	quotemstr	SamB: There are automated tests in Windows to stamp that practice out.
2014-01-22 23:22:07	quotemstr	SamB: In any case, it's harder to be fine-grained in the POSIXy world.
2014-01-22 23:22:11	quotemstr	You're either root or you're not. 
2014-01-22 23:22:16	quotemstr	Yes, there's selinux. Yes, there's AppArmor.
2014-01-22 23:22:25	quotemstr	Yes, you can open resources before dropping privileges. But often, it doesn't work.
2014-01-22 23:22:26	SamB	I mean, that they need for some, but not most, of their work

2014-01-23 16:59:33	wgreenhouse	galex-713: 1) if you later add nntp servers as gnus-secondary-select-methods, they will be distinct from the mail folders because their names will look like nntp+news.foo.org:comp.lang.lisp.  2) you may need to manually edit .newsrc.eld before you move nnml to gnus-select-method, e.g. replace nnml: with the empty string throughout the file.

2014-01-23 17:56:01	jlf	hmm, it just occurred to me that by s/RET/<return>/ in existing key binding forms i could free up for my own use bindings like C-m, C-x C-m, C-c C-m, etc.  the obvious drawback is that i could only do so in gui mode, but the benefit would be that i could safely do so with little risk of conflicting with standard bindings due to their need to support -nw usage.

2014-01-23 19:17:41	max3	i installed auto-complete from the package manager and it's working in a strange way. when i start emacs auto-complete is in my completions list but not auto-complete-mode. if execute M-x auto-complete it tells me auto-complete-mode not enabled but then as if by magic afterward auto-complete-mode does appear in my completion list and i can enable it

2014-01-23 20:14:36	drmeister	SamB: Right *character* offsets.   Number of characters from the beginning of the file.
2014-01-23 20:14:42	tali713	which includes instructions on the site for how to get slime/swank working.

2014-01-23 20:15:42	Petit_Dejeuner_	tali713, I guess I'll try that instead. It's too bad, since lispcabinet has everything preconfigured decently.
2014-01-23 20:15:45	drmeister	SamB: I've written a clang refactoring tool that generates source-to-source translation replacements.  The clang developers store the filename and character offset within each Replacement object - no line number (sigh).
2014-01-23 20:16:18	drmeister	I'd like to use emacs to jump from one potential replacement to the next as I can in grep-mode to verify that the tool is doing the right thing.
2014-01-23 20:16:27	SamB	drmeister: don't they have some sort of offset <-> line/column conversion tool?
2014-01-23 20:17:06	avar	they must since clang emits line numbers in error messages
2014-01-23 20:17:12	SamB	avar: I know, right?

2014-01-23 23:03:30	ustunozgur	perhaps, but it should auto-bookmark whenever I change the position of the cursor. not sure how to explain it properly perhaps, if you use IntelliJ, it's bound to Cmd-[ and Cmd-] by default there. Just like a browser's back and forward buttons.

2014-01-23 23:06:52	mrcheeks	ustunozgur: basically you want the behaviour of the previous file with position and next file buttons right? Like in Eclipse or Intellij?
