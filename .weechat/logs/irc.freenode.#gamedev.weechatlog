2013-12-03 10:14:50	itidus21	so i think that making things happen, whether in a simulation or infact in real life seems to be about working within constraints of time and space and energy
2013-12-03 10:15:53	itidus21	but on the other hand in real life you don't need the pretense of simulation...
2013-12-03 10:16:08	itidus21	a thing is where it is because it's there.

2013-12-03 10:21:58	itidus21	to this extent, i think one of the first things programmers learn is that they can't do what they want on their own terms. they have to express what they want in the computer's language.

2013-12-03 10:23:18	itidus21	and so it can seem that doing things efficiently is intelligent. but it's also a trade off. 
2013-12-03 10:24:14	itidus21	like compression for example tends to happen behind the scenes, inside the black box. it's not very useful as an end in itself.

2013-12-03 10:37:37	itidus21	to me, the levels in a video game are akin to a daily comic strip

2013-12-03 10:55:03	itidus21	hmm. so this gets me thinking. the trouble with the lego-ish games like minecraft is theres very few rules to the block building. if i understand correctly the rule in minecraft is you have to place a block next to an existing block. i forget if its the same thing in terraria
