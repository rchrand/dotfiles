2013-11-11 21:09:47	kristof	Earnestly: You know, I don't necessarily need open-source hardware. I just need the designs to be available to me if I'm a legal purchaser (similar to how the GPL doesn't require the source to be available to non-purchasers)
2013-11-11 21:09:55	Earnestly	But tbh, networking is something a "system daemon" should manage imo

2013-11-11 21:24:04	ehtesh	alright... arch feels a bit too daunting. I still haven't: 1. gotten hibernate to work. 2. figured out wifi-roaming (netctl-auto@.service), 3. dropbox on boot (dropbox@.service). Spent more time on these than expected...
2013-11-11 21:24:07	Earnestly	You can install an entirely BSD-based kernel/userspace/libc whatever with Gentoo, making it a bit odd to call it a "Linux" distro :P
2013-11-11 21:24:12	Black_Prince	Gentoo/FreeBSD and Debian/kFreeBSD are irrelevant when it comes to their linux counterpart
2013-11-11 21:24:20	Earnestly	Shinryuu: Stop using netctl

2013-11-11 21:24:45	jakedust	Earnestly: well, you probably also can use a BSD userspace and libc with arch
2013-11-11 21:24:51	Black_Prince	wpa_supplicant!

2013-11-11 21:25:18	Earnestly	netctl is a fragile wrapper bash script which is often broken
2013-11-11 21:25:23	ehtesh	wpa_supplicant is used to connect? and here I thought it was for WPA only...?
2013-11-11 21:25:35	kristof	ehtesh: Hibernate involves three things. One - adding "resume" to your initcpio. Two - Passing the resume option to the kernel at boot. And Three - having a SWAP partition or a SWAP file.
2013-11-11 21:25:43	Black_Prince	wep, wpa, plain ...
2013-11-11 21:25:45	jakedust	ehtesh: legacy names :)

2013-11-11 21:26:45	jakedust	well, everything can do WEP.
