2013-12-22 12:36:52	kurahaupo_mobile	MaximB it would help a lot if the datea in the log were lexicographically sortable
2013-12-22 12:39:49	kurahaupo_mobile	MaximB but failing that, you'll find the whole task easier to do in sonething like Perl or Python

2013-12-22 12:46:04	kurahaupo_mobile	MaximB If you insist on Bash, then you'll first need to generate a regex which matches dates to exclude, or conversely to include. That's doable but not easy even for an experienced programmer
2013-12-22 12:47:27	MaximB	kurahaupo_mobile: my python skills are very basic, and perl skills are non-existing.  but I don't imagine it to be hard to do in bash. it's just grep all the lines with 'never' in them (already got that), in each such line that the date (in each line there is a date), take that date+30days and see if it's "lower" than the current date and show the results
2013-12-22 12:47:45	MaximB	sounds simple, but maybe I'm wrong
2013-12-22 12:48:32	kurahaupo_mobile	MaximB how big is the input? what proportion is likely output?

2013-12-22 14:59:52	greybot	MaximB: The ''for var in ..'' statement iterates over arguments. for ((i=0; i < n; i++)) iterates over a numeric range. To iterate over filenames, use ''for file in [glob]''. Do *NOT* do ''for foo in `cat,ls,find,...`'': Here, for will iterate over resulting WORDS, NOT the "filenames", or "lines" that the command outputs.
2013-12-22 15:00:09	ormaaj	!` > MaximB
2013-12-22 15:00:09	greybot	MaximB: The backquote (`) is used in the old-style command substitution, e.g. foo=`command`. The foo=$(command) syntax is recommended instead. Backslash handling inside $() is less surprising, and $() is easier to nest. See http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/082
