2013-12-08 15:03:15	cdehaan	I want to run a few separate things on a single VPS (Digital Ocean, though I doubt that matters). It sounds like Docker is a great solution, so I can separate things a bit, and add/remove containers within the VPS without having to reinstall if I mess something up or have a bad software update within one container.
2013-12-08 15:03:35	cdehaan	Is this kind of right, given the 'usual caveats'

2013-12-08 15:28:13	pesadilla	Hello :)
2013-12-08 15:28:36	<--	rogaha has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-12-08 15:28:36	pesadilla	I would like to ask if is possible to use module loop inside a container.. without use -priviled option
2013-12-08 15:29:13	-->	rogaha has joined #docker
2013-12-08 15:29:21	bkc_	module loop?
2013-12-08 15:29:36	pesadilla	to use losetup
2013-12-08 15:29:40	bkc_	loop-mount
2013-12-08 15:29:49	pesadilla	and devices /dev/loop0
2013-12-08 15:30:06	bkc_	no, needs -privileged
2013-12-08 15:30:33	pesadilla	aha ok, thanks
2013-12-08 15:30:52	bkc_	and even then I wonder if you can TBH... chroots/lxc/jails/etc shouldn't be able to mount... period
2013-12-08 15:31:41	pesadilla	with -privilleged I'm able to do it.. my ide is to have some files and use them as devices
2013-12-08 15:31:50	pesadilla	idea*
2013-12-08 15:32:31	pesadilla	but with -privileged I'm more limited, but I will try find a solution

2013-12-12 16:55:42	Ayey_	Is it possible (I'm still new to Docker) for creating a workflow that goes like this: After you have built the image, which runs a single nodejs file, then while it's running, make some changes to the file, and then rerun it.. Without killing the container, building the image and running it again?

2013-12-12 17:08:26	tianon	HashNuke_: you take the image ID that's printed at the end of the build and do: docker run -i -t <image-id> <cmd>
2013-12-12 17:08:53	tianon	HashNuke_: it's probably easier if you use something like: docker build -t hashnuke/some-image-name .
2013-12-12 17:08:55	-->	icco has joined #docker
2013-12-12 17:09:05	tianon	HashNuke_: because then you have an explicit name to refer to in "docker run"
2013-12-12 17:09:24	HashNuke_	tianon: ya Ill do that. is there a way to destroy the image I just built? So that I can give it a name instead of having a hash

2013-12-12 17:11:05	bryanp	In docker-py, create_container takes a 'port' variable, but it's only setting the external ports. Anybody have experience with the docker libraries?
2013-12-12 17:11:26	agriffis	hi all. I'm playing with docker for the first time, apart from being a long-time customer of dotcloud. It seems like I have connectivity from the container to the host (ping host IP works) but not from the container to the rest of the network. What might I be missing?
2013-12-12 17:11:42	bryanp	I wanna say, "yo container, make yo-self with python, open port 22"

2013-12-12 17:18:01	jxf	RoosterJuice: The only advantage I can think of is if you were working on more than one project at once. Then you'd probably want to keep their environments isolated.
2013-12-12 17:18:07	KoFFiE	you *could* do that with docker
2013-12-12 17:18:34	jxf	RoosterJuice: But like KoFFiE said, any VM-provisioning tool will do that, not just Docker. Docker is about repeatable, packaged deployment.
2013-12-12 17:18:42	RoosterJuice	KoFFiE, ya i currently use virtualenv for that
2013-12-12 17:18:48	agriffis	tianon: no firewall rules at all. All policies ACCPET
2013-12-12 17:18:51	agriffis	ACCEPT rather
2013-12-12 17:18:55	jxf	RoosterJuice: That's not the same thing. That isolates your *Python* environment.
2013-12-12 17:19:02	KoFFiE	well you can run virtualenv in your vagrant vm :)
2013-12-12 17:19:11	jxf	RoosterJuice: Your applicant may have *system* dependencies, whether you know it or not.

2013-12-12 17:19:36	RoosterJuice	ah. jxf so if I wanted to deploy a website on a different server?
2013-12-12 17:19:38	KoFFiE	you could use docker if you create a 'production environment' image, and want to test in that environment during development
2013-12-12 17:19:44	tianon	agriffis: what's your current platform?  Ubuntu?  RH?
2013-12-12 17:19:57	jxf	RoosterJuice: That'd be a great use for Docker. :)

2013-12-12 17:23:13	RoosterJuice	jxf, so if the target server was already running apache on it, would there be any conflicts with ports and stuff?

2013-12-12 17:23:47	KoFFiE	RoosterJuice: no, it creates a new IP for your docker image (which isn't reachable from the outside by default)
2013-12-12 17:24:05	RoosterJuice	and then you just change your iptable?

2013-12-12 17:24:37	-->	MattJ has joined #docker
2013-12-12 17:24:40	KoFFiE	you can, or run an nginx or apache (or whatever) in front of it, acting as a proxy
2013-12-12 17:24:52	agriffis	tianon: so the default config for docker networking is NAT?
2013-12-12 17:24:57	jxf	RoosterJuice: That'd be one way to do it. Anything can do the mapping though.

2013-12-12 17:25:36	RoosterJuice	ok so it basically creates a virtual server that your current server can connect to via a local ip

2013-12-12 17:25:52	RoosterJuice	but not a true virtual server
2013-12-12 17:26:03	KoFFiE	RoosterJuice: deploying a new version would then be: pull new image, run it next to the old version, switch port forwarding/proxy/whatever - and you have your new version up & running

2013-12-12 17:31:01	KoFFiE	you can also just use files instead

2013-12-12 17:31:44	agriffis	tianon, KoFFiE: I'm familiar with NAT using iptables, but considering my host has no iptables rules, this seems to be using something else?
2013-12-12 17:31:51	RoosterJuice	so if it comes from a repository, would this be INSTEAD of using git?
2013-12-12 17:32:03	RoosterJuice	or would I still ahve to use git?
2013-12-12 17:32:09	KoFFiE	agriffis: it adds to the prerouting

IF it works correctly, I would kill the current live site.

2013-12-12 18:15:38	garetjax	btw, if you leave HostIp empty, it will bind on all interfaces

2013-12-12 19:06:06	stphung	hey guys, I am interested in using docker to run a "full ubuntu vm", basically i want to have the upstart process manager run and manage a bunch of processes as opposed to running a single command.  I hear there is work going on with this, could someone point me in that direction?
2013-12-12 19:06:35	sec^nd	are volumes per container?
