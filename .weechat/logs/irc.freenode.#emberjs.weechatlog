2013-11-11 17:34:14	SinisterMinister	I think I may need to implement unknownProperty and proxy everything through it. After the object. The object is instantiated in the model method on the route. It returns an RSVP promise
2013-11-11 17:34:25	SinisterMinister	the promise returns the ORM object on resolve

2013-11-11 18:27:50	SinisterMinister	locks: yeah, it's built around the idea of using repositories as the DAL, so you can swap them out with other persistent stores (mysql, mongo, etc). One of the things the repository will do is provide a schema that the ORM uses to build its models
2013-11-11 18:28:08	SinisterMinister	The mysql repo uses introspection to build the schema based on the tables in your database
2013-11-11 18:28:24	endash	knownasilya: createWithMixins
2013-11-11 18:28:25	SinisterMinister	so if you have a `users` table, you could just call ORM.factory('user') and have a user model to work with
2013-11-11 18:28:31	locks	sounds interesting and complicated :P

2013-11-11 18:29:17	SinisterMinister	thanks
